Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Oh, I get it. You guys aren't allowed to talk. Is that it? Are you not allowed to talk? One Airman grins, fidgeting with his orange NY Mets watch."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,JIMMY,No. We're allowed to talk.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Oh. I see. So it's personal.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAMIREZ,I think they're intimidated.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Good God, you're a woman. The others try to compress laughs."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"I, honestly, I couldn't have called that. (after silence) I would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I saw you as a soldier first."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,JIMMY,"I have a question, sir."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Please.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,JIMMY,Is it true you're twelve for twelve with last years Maxim cover girls?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a schedule conflict but, thankfully, the Christmas cover was twins. Anyone else? You, with the hand up."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PRATT,It's a little embarrassing.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Join the club.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PRATT,Can I take a picture with you?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Are you aware that Native Americans believe photographs steal a little piece of your soul? (then) Not to worry, mine's long gone. Fire away. Pratt, excited, poses as another Airman snaps the photo. A second later A MASSIVE EXPLOSION rocks them. Through the windshield, the Humvee ahead of them erupts in a fireball. Tony is flung aside, and in the side-mirror The Humvee behind them EXPLODES. Pandemonium as The Airmen are instantly in battle mode. They scramble out, shutting Tony inside."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PRATT,"STAY HERE! TONY'S POV - OF JIMMY: as he's stitched by a bouncing Betty mine. Now, running past, firing a .50 cal. machine gun is -- USAF Lt. Colonel JAMES ""RHODEY"" RHODES. He looks in."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"GET DOWN, TONY. GET THE -- An EXPLOSION cuts him off. Rhodey fires through the chaos, covering all directions, then advances into the murk. Another Hummer goes up in a fireball, and now -- Tony's window blows in, spraying glass and shrapnel. He scrambles for the door. 3 EXT. TONY'S HUMVEE - SECONDS LATER	3 Smoke. Machine gun fire. Tracers zip past. SHOUTING. Tony ducks, scampering along. He spots an M-16, picks it up, but the weapon is burning hot. He drops it, moves on when-- Something PINGS off a smoldering Humvee and thuds in the dirt near him. He spins and we -- SNAP ZOOM TO: an RPG, revealing its pedigree, ""USM 11676 - STARK MUNITIONS."" Just as we suspect it's a dud, it DETONATES and throws Tony back, shredding his suit and revealing his body armor underneath. Over the chatter of SMALL ARMS FIRE we -- FADE TO WHITE: 4 INT. INSURGENT CAVE - AFGHANISTAN - DAY	4 Tony snaps awake. He's tied to a chair, bloody rags covering his chest. Two Insurgents flank a DV camera. Behind Tony a line of armed hooded men and a banner showing ten interlocked rings. The Leader, a huge Choori knife in one hand, reads rhetoric (in Dari) for the camera. PUSH IN ON - THE DV CAMERA VIEWFINDER: until the image of a desperate Tony breaks up into pixel chaos. CUT TO: 5 CREDITS OVER A FULL SCREEN FILM REEL	5 The attack on Pearl Harbor. FDR gives an impassioned speech."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,NARRATOR,"December 7, 1941: the day the world changed forever. President Roosevelt declares the United States will build fifty thousand planes to fight the armies of Hirohito and Hitler-- S.S. Officers goose-step through Paris."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,NARRATOR,"Although no such capacity to build existed -- 1940s L.A., an unassuming hangar reads: ""STARK INDUSTRIES."""
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,NARRATOR,"Howard Stark, founder of the fledgling Stark Industries, answers his call to duty -- A Young Howard Stark shakes FDR's hand."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,NARRATOR,"And builds not fifty, but a hundred thousand planes. An airfield covered in B-29s. Stark bombers in flight, strewing bombs and paratroopers across the sky."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,NARRATOR,"Later, Stark's work on the Manhattan project makes the end of the war possible. A mushroom cloud in the New Mexico desert. Howard Stark observes with Oppenheimer."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,NARRATOR,"Stark Industries would go on to contribute to every major weapons system through the Cold War -- Korean War, B-52s, ICBMS, nuclear subs, F-16s launching from carriers. Howard Stark with Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,NARRATOR,"But Howard Stark's greatest achievement would come in 1973-- President Ford, holding baby Tony, posing with Howard. Four year-old Tony building a massive building-block city. Howard and twelve year-old Tony assembling a hot-rod engine."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,NARRATOR,"From early on, it was clear that Tony Stark had a unique gift-- Tony working on TURBINE ENGINES in a hangar full of F-18s."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,NARRATOR,"At seventeen he graduated summa cum laude from MIT. Four years later, tragedy would pass the Stark mantle from father to son-- Howard's funeral. Tony with Reagan, Bush Sr. and Clinton."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,NARRATOR,The loss of a titan. But Tony did not let personal grief distract him from his duty -- Tony cuts the ribbon on a brand new ARK REACTOR at Stark Industries West Coast HQ.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,NARRATOR,"At twenty-one, he became the youngest-ever CEO of a Fortune 500 company. And with it came a new mandate -- A laser-guided bomb hits its target."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,NARRATOR,"Smarter weapons, fewer casualties. A dedication to preserving life. A visual crescendo of America's modern military might."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,NARRATOR,"Today Tony Stark's ingenuity continues to protect freedom and American interest around the globe. A waving American flag superimposed with an Annie Liebowitz portrait of Tony. And as it fades out, APPLAUSE, then a light shines on a podium, revealing Lt. Colonel Rhodes."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"As Program Manager and Liaison to Stark Industries, I've had the honor of serving with a real patriot, a man whose life has been dedicated to protecting our troops on the front lines. He's a friend. And a great mentor. A man who has always been there for his friends and his country. Ladies and gentlemen, this year's ARES Award winner -- Mr. Tony Stark. THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE. A spotlight fixes on Tony Stark or rather his empty chair. Applause wanes, lights fade up -- 6 INT. BALLROOM - CAESAR'S PALACE - LAS VEGAS - NIGHT	6 Military brass, politicians, movers and shakers. Heads swivel and MURMUR, where's Tony? OBADIAH STANE (50s), CFO of Stark Industries, regards the empty chair. He makes his way to the podium. Awkward."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"Thank you-- I, uhhh, I'm not Tony Stark, but if I were Tony, I'd tell you how honored I am and-- what a joy it is to receive this award. (then) The best thing about Tony is also the worst thing, he's always working. SMASH CUT TO: 7 INT. CASINO - CAESARS PALACE - NIGHT	7 Tony plays craps, a crowd erupting as they all win big. Chips pile up. Tony's flanked on both sides by lucky ladies. In between rolls, he whispers into one Woman's ear --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"--you think we're having a 'moment' here, but this is actually the logical conclusion of several mathematical truisms. Your hypothalamus is flooding your system with a chain of proteins called peptides, so that every cell in your body is opening itself up to the happy chemical: oxytocin."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,WOMAN,(seriously turned on) That's-- wow--
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Hold on a second -- He rolls again. The table is hot. More cheers.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"-- so now your limbic system is positively throbbing. A Kirlian photograph of us right now, occupying this space, would show serious subatomic particles being exchanged between us, with a rapidity that transcends-- (then) Are you getting this? You will be quizzed -- And now he sees Rhodey pulling up, glowering."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"My God, what are you, they roped you into this thing too?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,Yeah. They said you'd be deeply honored if I presented.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Okay, let's do it. Rhodey plops the ARES statue down on the felt."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"That was quick. Thought there'd be more of, you know, a ceremony. Maybe a highlight reel -- Tony shakes karma into the dice, rolls again. He craps out. Groans from the table, everyone staring at Rhodey the ""cooler""."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"(to the Boxman) Colore me up. (turns others) My chaperone has just arrived with my -- (holding the ARES) -- Degenerate of the Year Award. Judging from his look, I may have just peed in the kiddie pool. The Boxman racks up Tony's chips."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"I must now take my ease, along with the House's funds. He's handed racks of chips, then tips the table Operators and heads off with Rhodey. Two hotel Security Guards fall in behind. As they meander past tables -- People gawk, snap photos of Tony with their phones."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,A lot of people would kill to have their name on that award.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,It belongs to my old man. They should have given it to him.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"What's wrong with you? A thousand people came here tonight to honor you, and you leave them with egg on their face. This award means something, Tony, it's bigger than you --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Hold that thought a sec. He's stopped in front of a roulette wheel. Puts all his chips down on, nods to wheel operator."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Put it all on black. Don't worry -- it's approved. The Wheel Operator spins. CLOSE ON - ROULETTE WHEEL: the ball finally settling on red. The Dealer scoops away Tony's chips.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,--you just blew three million.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Yeah. Don't know what was more exciting -- winning it-- or the fact that I don't care I just lost it.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,Everything's funny to you.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,No. You're not funny.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,We've got a hell of a day tomorrow. Can we get out of here now?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,One more stop. CUT TO: B8 INT. BATHROOMS - CAESARS PALACE - NIGHT	B8 An empty palatial bathroom. Tony's in the stall on his throne. Rhodey splashes his face by the mirrors.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Of course I respect your opinion.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,This is no joke. You're going into a hot zone. We should be doing this test here in Nevada.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"This system has to be demonstrated in true field conditions. The Bathroom door swings open and VIRGINIA ""PEPPER"" POTTS enters, Tony's sexy and very capable assistant."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Tony, it's the President. Wants to congratulate you personally. Heads up. She tosses the cellphone over the top of the stall. All very routine. Rhodey listens to Tony talk, shaking his head."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Jim, how're the trout running? Yeah, sitting on top of the world here. Working on my masterpiece --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,A MINUTE LATER,"Tony washes up. As they leave, Rhodey drops money in the absent Attendant's tip basket. Tony adds the ARES statue to the basket and follows Rhodey out. 9 INT. CASINO FLOOR - CAESAR'S PALACE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT	9 Hotel Guards have patrons cordoned outside the bathroom. We PICK UP Tony and Pepper in mid walk-and-talk."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,You're leaving the country for a week. I need five minutes --
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Okay -- shoot. 10 EXT. CAESAR'S PALACE - NIGHT	10 Tony heads for his waiting limo, the entourage hanging back."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"(checking her tablet PC) The Board meeting is on the eleventh. Should I tell them to expect an appearance--? WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Mr. Stark! Tony turns, spots CHRISTINE EVERHART, a hot young Reporter holding a recorder. Security keeps her at bay."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CHRISTINE,"Christine Everhart, Vanity Fair Magazine. Can I ask you a few questions?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Can I ask a few back? She gives him a disarming smile. Tony waves at Security to let her through. Pepper shakes her head, then takes a call."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CHRISTINE,You've been described as a Da Vinci for our times. What do you say to that?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Ridiculous. I don't paint.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CHRISTINE,"And what do you say to your other nickname: ""The Merchant of Death?"""
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,That's not bad -- Her gaze is suddenly cold.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Let me guess. Berkeley?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CHRISTINE,Brown.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Well Miss Brown, it's an imperfect world and I assure you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start manufacturing bricks and beams to make baby hospitals."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CHRISTINE,"Rehearse that much, Mr. Stark?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Every night in front of the mirror. Call me Tony.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CHRISTINE,"I'm sorry, ""Tony"", I was hoping for a serious answer."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Here's serious: my old man had a philosophy: peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CHRISTINE,"Good line, coming from the guy selling the sticks."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,My father helped defeat Hitler. He was on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people including your professors at Brown might call that being a hero.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CHRISTINE,"Others might call it war- profiteering. Tony has to smile, this gal is relentless."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Tell me: do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology? Or kept from starving with our inteli- crops? All were breakthroughs spawned from, that's right, military funding."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CHRISTINE,"Wow. You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life? He regards her in earnest, then off her drop-dead look we -- SMASH CUT TO: 11 INT. TONY'S BEDROOM - STARK ESTATE - NIGHT	11 Christine and Tony, half naked, crashing about. She's the one attacking. They flop out of frame. 12 INT. TONY'S BEDROOM - MORNING	12 A clock changing from ""5:59AM"" to 6:00"". Christine awakens alone, as the room begins to transform. Darkened windows turn translucent, admitting light. She rises, startled by the TV flickering alive as she passes it. She looks out the window -- hell of a view. REVERSE ANGLE - OUTSIDE WINDOW. As we PULL AWAY and establish Tony's estate, perched impossibly on the cliffs above the Pacific. BACK TO: 13 INT. TONY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME	13 Christine pads over to the closet, tries to open it. JARVIS (O.S.) I'm sorry, Miss Everhart, you are not authorized to access that area. She jumps, freaked out, grabs for Tony's shirt on the floor and covers herself. Just then Pepper enters, holding dry- cleaned clothes in plastic."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"(re: the voice) Don't worry, that's Jarvis -- he runs the house. Jarvis: de- activate security. Pepper eyes Tony's oversized shirt on Christine."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Here, your clothes cleaned and pressed. Anything else I can get you?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CHRISTINE,"Look, Tony wanted me to stay for breakfast, but I've got to get a jump on the day. Call me a cab, would you?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Cab's waiting outside. A beat, then --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CHRISTINE,"And a coffee, hon. Black. One Splenda."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"(smiling sweetly) Should I tell Mr. Stark you were satisfied with the interview? 14 INT. TONY'S WORKSHOP - MORNING	14 It's like the chaos inside Tony's head, ultra-modern drones and missile parts, sports cars and long-abandoned prototypes. Framed photos of Tony and his Dad working on a classic '32 Ford. MUSIC drifts from an old Wurlitzer. We drift past: screens containing various CAD images of a flathead engine, and finally we find -- Tony, in suit-slacks and an undershirt, grimy from working on the same '32 Ford as in the photo. Pepper enters holding her PDA."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,You still owe me five minutes--
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Five? I'll need a bit longer than that --
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Focus. I need to leave on time today.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"You're rushing me. What, you have plans tonight?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,The MIT commencement. Yes or no?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Maybe. Tell me your plans.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,I'll tell them 'yes'. You want to buy the Jackson Pollock? He's got another buyer in the wings --
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,What's it look like?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"It's a minor work in his later Spring Period, it's ludicrously over-priced--"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Buy it. She's interrupted by her phone and taps her bluetooth headset. Listens.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,He left an hour ago. Okay. (hangs up) It's Rhodey again.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"You have plans, don't you --?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,It's your birthday again?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Yep. Funny, same day as last year."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Well, get yourself something from me. Something nice."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Already did.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,And?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"It was very tasteful, very elegant. Thank you, Mr. Stark."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"You're welcome, Miss Potts. 15 EXT. STARK AVIATION HANGAR - SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - DAY	15 Rhodey, in uniform, paces talking on a cellphone. Behind him a parked Boeing Business Jet reading: STARK INTERNATIONAL, ""TOMORROW TODAY."" A GROWING RUMBLE and Rhodey turns to see a Saleen S7 roaring up, stopping short of him. Seconds later a Rolls limo arrives. Tony's chauffeur HOGAN pops the trunk and takes out: a single overnight suitcase. The Saleen's scissor-doors open, Tony jumps out. He heads for the Boeing, right past Rhodey."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Sorry, pal, car trouble. 16 INT. TONY'S PLANE - PARKED - DAY	16 Rhodey, steaming, settles into his seat."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"I was standing out there three hours, what the hell --?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,I had car trouble. A hot Flight Attendant holds out steamy towels with thongs.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Thanks, maybe later. Rhodey grabs a towel. The WHINE of ENGINES build. 17 INT. TONY'S PLANE - FLYING - DAY	17 A Flight Attendant stops by their seats."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,ATTENDANT,"Would you like a drink, Mr. Stark?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Two fingers of Laphroig. (to Rhodey) You want one?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,We're working.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,You should have a drink. We've got a twelve hour flight ahead of us.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,It's two in the afternoon.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"It's two in the morning where we're going. C'mon, ten hours ""bottle to throttle --"""
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,Don't start with me.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Jeez, we're not getting hammered. Just a nightcap. We'll sleep better, arrive fresh. It's the responsible thing to do. I don't know about you, but I want to sell some weapons. Off Rhodey's stoic look, we -- SMASH CUT TO: 18 INT. TONY'S PLANE - FLYING - NIGHT	18 MUSIC blares. Tony and Rhodey sip drinks, comfortably numb and oblivious to the flight attendants dancing next to them."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"(a few drinks in) You don't get it. I don't work for the military because they paid for my education, or my father's education. Don't cheapen it like that."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"All I said was, with your smarts, your engineering background, you could write your own ticket in the private sector -- on top of which, you wouldn't have to wear that 'straight-jacket'."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"'Straight-jacket'? This uniform means something. A chance to make a difference. You don't respect that, because you don't understand."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"(motions with a nod) See that one? Her I understand. Croatian. Hot-blooded, I'm serious. Must be those winters in Zagreb --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,You're not listening to a word I'm saying.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"I am listening. I'm changing the subject. It's the same litany, every time you've had a thimble of alcohol. Drink One: reflections on the New American Century and related topics --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"Something's seriously wrong with you, man."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Drink 2: a history of World War II and the Tuskeegee Flyers. Drink 3--
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"You know, hell with you. I'm not talking to you anymore. He undoes his seatbelt, rises, looking for somewhere else to sit."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Go hang with the pilot. You'll get along, he's got a personality just like yours."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"I will. Rhodey heads to the cockpit and opens the door. RHODEY'S POV - THE COCKPIT Two empty pilot chairs, a fully-automated flight system. As Rhodey returns to his seat."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,That's funny.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"You could tell? 19 EXT. BAGRAM AFB - AFGHANISTAN - DAY	19 Tony exits the plane, fresh, fired up to greet the waiting brass. He shakes hands. Then -- Rhodey appears dressed in ABUs. He's weary, squinting at the stinging sun. Pulls his sunglasses down over bleary eyes. Three JERICHO MISSILES on a 'flatbed' (which have been unloaded from a military jet in the b.g.) are brought under heavy guard to a waiting convoy. The CHATTER of MACHINE GUN fire and we -- CUT TO: 20 EXT. DESERT TEST SITE - AFGHANISTAN - DAY	20 Tony firing a N.R.F. 425 MACHINE GUN. Generals sit on folding chairs behind a safe-zone of Hescos and sand-bags. Afghani soldiers and SF (Air Force security) men patrol the perimeter. Tony puts the N.R.F. 425 gun down next to other weapons. He struts before the Generals like a carnival barker."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"The age old question: is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both? He nods at the Jericho Missile, on a mobile launcher."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries Freedom Line. It's the first missile system to incorporate my proprietary Repulsor Technology. They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I prefer the one you only have to fire once... The Jericho ROARS into the sky from a mobile launcher."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"That's how dad did it, it's how America does it, and so far its worked out pretty well. Find an excuse to fire off one of these and I personally guarantee the enemy is not gonna want to leave their caves. FLASH TO: the Jericho, as it divides from a single missile, into scores of mini-missiles."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,ANGLE - ON TONY,A row of majestic peaks behind him. He raises his arms.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"For your consideration, the Jericho-- The mountains behind his outstretched hands explode. The shock-wave washes over Tony, blanking him with dust. REVERSE ANGLE As the shock-wave erases the observing Generals with dust."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Now there's one last creation I haven't shown anyone yet. You might be interested-- He opens a large silver case. Ice-smoke curls out, then -- A bottle appears. Drink glasses. As Tony pours the Generals and Afghani military officials exchange awkward glances."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"(raises his glass) To peace, gentlemen and with every five hundred million, I'll throw in a free one of these. 21 EXT. DESERT TEST SITE - DAY	21 The Generals board their Humvees and depart to the East. Tony and Rhodey walk to their convoy of waiting Humvees, pointing West. Tony gets Obadiah Stane on his video-phone."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Hey, what are you doing up?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,Sleeping. How did it go?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,I think we got an early Christmas coming.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,Sounds good.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Hey, why aren't you wearing the PJs I got you?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"I don't do monograms. I'm hanging up now, bye-bye. Stane hangs up."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"All right, who wants to ride with me? Jimmy?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,JIMMY,"(psyched) Me? Jazzed, Jimmy and the others jump into the lead Humvee. As Rhodey approaches --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Sorry, Rhodey, no room for my conscience in here. Or that hang- dog look. (raising his glass) See you back at base. Rhodey shakes his head, and heads for a different Humvee. ROCK MUSIC is cranked up on a boom-box. And as Tony's door slams shut. SMASH CUT TO: 22 INT. CRUDE OPERATING ROOM - CAVE - AFGHANISTAN - NIGHT	22 Nightmarish. GARBLED VOICES. Stabbing lights. Tony thrashes against a restraining belt. Impressionistic glimpses: a red scalpel. Blood-spattered hands. Tony's heaving chest. A boilerplate. TONY'S POV: YINSEN (60s), looks down on us, performing the ""operation"". He yells to someone in Arabic, and -- Tony is held down, a chloroform rag is pressed to his face. 23 INT. LAB - CAVE - DAY	23 Tony flickers awake, disoriented. A tube protrudes from his nose. He sees -- Yinsen, humming a tune as he shaves by a broken mirror. But more importantly right now -- There is a jug of water on the table. Tony tries to speak, can't. It's the damn nasal tube. He pulls at it, gagging as two of feet of tubing slithers from his nose."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"(hoarse whisper) --water-- water. Yinsen keeps humming. Tony yanks the IV from his arm and stretches for the water, but is stopped by a wire, under his chest bandages, snapping taut."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"I wouldn't do that if I were you. Tony follows the wire with his eyes and finds, to his horror, that it's hooked up to a car battery. He starts clawing at his chest bandages. Yinsen turns. Tony sees his ugly chest wound. It's too much. He swoons. 24 INT. LAB - CAVE - HOURS LATER - DAY	24 Yinsen stirs a bubbling pot on the furnace. He flicks glances at Tony, waking up on the cot. Tony eyes the bulky chest-piece protruding from his fresh bandages."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,What have you done to me?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"What did I do? I removed what I could, but there's a lot left headed for you atrial septum. Do you want a souvenir? He tosses Tony a jar with scores of bloody Christmas tree- like barbs. Tony regards the 'shrapnel' he owns the patent to, and lets the jar drop."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"I've seen many wounds like this in my village. The walking dead we called them, because it took a week for the barbs to reach vital organs. I anchored a magnetic suspension system to the plate. It's holding the shrapnel in place at least for now. Tony struggles up, sits on the cot and notices something -- TONY'S POV: a surveillance camera on the cave wall."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"That's right, smile. (then) We met once -- at a technical conference in Bern."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,I don't remember.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"You wouldn't. If I'd been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand, much less give a talk on integrated circuits."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Where are we --? The door-slat flies opens and a pair of dark eyes stare in. Yinsen drops his spoon, puts his hands on his head."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"Stand up! Do as I do. Now! Tony gets to his feet, can't gets his hands up. Yinsen helps him."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"Listen to me, whatever they ask you, refuse. You understand? You must refuse. The door opens and ABU BAKAR enters with two armed Henchmen (Ahmed and Omar). On Ahmed's wrist, Tony notices -- Jimmy's bright orange METS watch (from the convoy earlier)."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,ABU,"(in Arabic) Welcome Tony Stark, the greatest mass murderer in the history of America. It's a great honor."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"(translating for Abu) He says welcome Tony Stark, the greatest mass murderer in the history of America. He is very honored. Abu looks Tony up and down like a prize horse, then --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,ABU,(in Arabic) I want you to build this for me -- the Jericho missile you were demonstrating. Abu holds out a photo: a surveillance image of the Jericho Missile launch.

Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"--I refuse. Yinsen backhands Tony across the face, goes ballistic --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"You refuse? You will do everything he says. This is the great Abu Bakar. You're alive only because of his generosity. You are nothing. NOTHING. He offers you his hospitality, and you answer only with insolence He will not be refused. You will die in a pool of your own blood. Abu, spooning down Yinsen's food, throws a look of smug satisfaction. He heads out. The door slams shut."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"Perfect. You did very well, Stark. Tony is utterly perplexed."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"Good, I think they're starting to trust me. Yinsen returns to cooking."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"Well, that's the end of my plan. 25 INT. LAB - CAVE - DAY	25 Tony is jostled awake by Abu's Henchmen, wrestling a hood over his head. He struggles as he's pulled to his feet. 26 INT. TUNNEL - CAVE - DAY	26 TONY'S POV - THROUGH HOOD: approaching the tunnel opening. 27 EXT. CAVE COMPLEX - MINUTES LATER - DAY	27 CLOSE ON - TONY: the hood is yanked off his head. He squints into the stinging daylight, his expression turning to shock. In a bowl of tall mountains, camouflaged tarps are furled, revealing skids upon skids of Stark Industries weapons dating back to 80s Afghanistan. VARIOUS SHOTS - OF CRATES: the STARK INTERNATIONAL MUNITIONS logos. Some faded, some new. Tony, stunned, staggers along the crates. Yinsen follows."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"Quite a collection, isn't it?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,How did they get all this?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,ABU YINSEN,"(in Arabic) (translation) As you see, we have As you can see, they have everything you need to build everything you need to build the Jericho.

Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,Something's not right.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,GABRIEL,Looks like a standard hit and run.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"Sir, I'm telling you, this was a snatch and grab. A perfectly executed linear ambush. As soon as they got what they wanted, they melted away."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,GABRIEL,"Intel's on it, we're in good hands. If he's out there, we'll get him. It hangs there, then --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,With your permission I'd like to stay in theater and head up the search and investigation.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,GABRIEL,There's a PR firestorm brewing over this. Right now the best way to serve your country is to get back there and handle it.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"Tony Stark is the DOD's number one intellectual asset, and I can be of value in the field."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,GABRIEL,"Duly noted, but we need you back home. (walks away, then) Colonel, it's not lost on me that Stark is a lifelong friend. Rhodey nods and heads for his Humvee as things are packed up. 29 INT. LAB - CAVE - DAYS LATER - DAY	29 Dark. Tony sits in a wheelbarrow by the furnace, wrapped in an Army surplus blanket. Yinsen looms over him."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark, but they will never find you here. (then) That car battery is running out and they won't turn on the generator till you start to work. Silence."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"You don't like what you saw out there, did you? I didn't like it either when those weapons destroyed my village. (beat) What you just saw, that's your legacy -- your life's work in the hands of these murderers. Is that how you want to go out? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark? Or are you going to try to do something about it?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Why should I do anything, they're either going to kill me or I'm going to die in a week."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"Then this is a very important week for you. 30 INT. LAB - CAVE - DAY	30 The lights come on as the generator is started. Abu is flanked by Ahmed and several Guards. He watches as Omar refuels the generator, then walks the gas can to a 'cage', housing a fuel drum, and locks that down too."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Okay, here's what I need. Tony paces, barking what he needs done while more of Abu's Guards carry in missiles and materials. Yinsen follows, translating as Tony assesses his work area."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY - YINSEN,"(in Arabic) S-Category missiles. Lot 7043. The S-30 explosive S-Category missiles. Lot tritonal. And a dozen of the 7043. The S-30 explosive S-76.

Iron_Man_Full_Script,,ABU,(in Arabic) A WASHING MACHINE? DOES HE THINK I'M A FOOL?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,(to Abu) Must have everything. Great Satan make big boom-kill for powerful Abu Bakar. Big boom-kill. 31 INT. LAB - CAVE - NEXT DAY - DAY	31 Tony pulls open a missile-housing and removes a glass ring from the inner workings of its guts. Then -- He leads Yinsen up to a large missile crate. They remove the chip-rack cylinder from a larger warhead.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,You do know they've removed all the explosives before they brought this to us.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"I know, they're crazy not stupid. Tony walks the heavy chip-rack to the work-bench and removes a tiny palladium strip."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,This is what we're looking for. I need eleven of these.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"Eleven? E32 INT. LAB - CAVE - LATER - DAY E32 SHOT OF: Yinsen removes chip-rack cylinders, bringing them to Tony. Tony extracts palladium strips."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Heat the palladium to 1825 Kelvin.

Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,The palladium will melt. LATER: INSERT OF: Tony wraps a copper coil around the glass ring. INSERT OF: Tony drops palladium strips into a crucible on the fire.

Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Oh yeah, thanks. What do I call you?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,My name is Yinsen.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Nice to meet you.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,Nice to meet you too. LATER: SHOT OF: Tony lifts the palladium ring out of the mold with a tweezer.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,What are you building?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,A better mousetrap. 33 INT. LAB - CAVE - DAY	33 Tony plugs a cable into the generator.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,What are you shaving for? We're almost done.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"(taking his time shaving) Look like an animal, and soon you'll start behaving like one. Tony throws a generator switch. The lights go up and down. INSERT SHOT OF: the finished RT device, wired to the generator cable, beginning to glow on the workbench. Yinsen wipes his face, and trails Tony to the workbench. He undoes the wires, holding up the glowing RT device."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,That's because it's a miniature ARK reactor. It should suspend the shrapnel in my chest and keep it from entering my heart.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,What an original invention.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Yeah, but this one is going to last a bit longer than a week."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"It's pretty small, what can it generate?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Three gigajoules -- per second. Yinsen marvels.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,That could run your heart for fifty lifetimes.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Or something very big for fifteen minutes. Their eyes meet a moment, then --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Let's put it in. 34 INT. RAZA'S CONTROL ROOM - CAVE - HOURS LATER - DAY	34 PUSH IN - MONITOR: Tony lying on a workbench, Yinsen craning over him.

Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"Sorry, did I startle you?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"A little-- He watches as Pepper swaps yesterday's unread L.A. Times and Wall Street Journal with today's. Her little vigil. Stane rises, gazes out the windows at the vast Stark compound. Pepper comes up behind him."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"This was a bad idea, I should never have let him go over there-- He starts to break down. She touches his shoulder."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Hey, hey-- we've got to be strong, he's going to be okay. He composes himself, nods. CUT TO: 36 INT. LAB - CAVE - WEEKS LATER - DAY	36 CLOSE ON - TONY'S OLD CAR BATTERY: we follow the wires and end on the bloody chest plate, no longer in Tony's chest. INSERT - TRACKING SHOT: of new set dressing, revealing that time has passed and 'missile' components have progressed (we see jig). We find Tony, bearded and filthy now, cutting metal flat- stock with a torch. His shirt is cracked open, revealing the glowing RT device in his chest. He snuffs the torch, looks over his shoulder at -- Yinsen concentrating on building a backgammon board. Tony secretly begins filling a cylinder with gas from the torch."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"(flicks a glance at Tony) Stark, tell me what you're doing, and I'll tell you what I'm doing."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Looks to me like you're making a crappy backgammon board.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,Crappy? This is Lebanese cedar.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Is that where you're from, Lebanon?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"I'm impressed you even know what this is. (then) How about we play, and if I win, you tell me what you're really making."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"""A"" I don't know what your talking about. ""B"" I was the backgammon champ at MIT four years running."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"Interesting, I was the champion at Cambridge."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Please don't use 'interesting' and Cambridge in the same sentence. (then) Is that still a school?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,It's a university. You probably haven't heard about it since Americans can't get in.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Unless they're teaching. The door-slat flies open. Abu again. He barks, more stern than usual. Tony stops, the secret cylinder he was filling, clatters to the floor. Yinsen notices, looks at Tony. Abu, Ahmed and Omar enter, followed by RAZA'S GUARDS. They take up positions, rigid. Raza enters (he speaks English)."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,"Relax. They lower their hands. Silence as Raza meanders, picking up and putting things down. He almost steps on Tony's secret cylinder, but then sees the washing machine. He shoots Abu a cold look and turns to the workbench and peruses Tony's onion-paper schematics of the missile."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,The bow and arrow was once the pinnacle of weapons technology. It allowed the great Genghis Khan to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine. He pushes the schematics around trying to make sense of them.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,Today-- whoever has the latest Stark weapons rules these lands. Soon it will be my turn-- A beat as Raza looks back and forth between Yinsen and Tony.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,(to Yinsen in Urdu) What's really going on here?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,(in Urdu) Nothing. We're working.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,(in Urdu) It's been a long time. Where's the weapon?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"(in Urdu) He's working very hard. It's very complex. Yinsen flicks a glance at Tony, who watches apprehensive."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,"(to Abu, in Urdu) Get him on his knees. Yinsen is forced to his knees by Abu and Ahmed. Using tongs, Raza lifts a hot coal from the furnace and approaches Yinsen."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,(in Urdu) Tell me what is going on?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,(in Urdu) Nothing! NOTHING is going on.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,(in Urdu) OPEN YOUR MOUTH! Yinsen won't do it. Abu and Ahmed force his mouth open. CLOSE ON - COAL: heading for Yinsen's mouth. He struggles.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,(in Urdu) TELL ME NOW!
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"(in Urdu) He's building your bomb. The glowing coal nearly at Yinsen's mouth now then -- Raza drops the coal on the floor in front of Yinsen and leaves. Raza's men follow and slam the door shut. Yinsen gathers himself, then --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"That's twice I saved your life. Now are you going to tell me what the hell you're really building? Their eyes hold, then -- CUT TO: 37 INT. LAB - CAVE - DAY - CONTINUOUS	37 CLOSE ON - LIGHT-BOARD: AS IT'S FLICKED ON. Tony lays schematic after schematic on the glass. CLOSE ON - YINSEN: surprise registering."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"Finally, an idea of your own. 38 INT. TUNNEL - CAVE - DAY	38 We follow Abu in a tunnel, heading for the lab. He shoves the door-slat aside. ABU'S POV - THROUGH SLAT: Tony, shaving in front of the broken mirror, turns. 39 INT. LAB - CAVE - CONTINUOUS - DAY	39 Abu shuts the door slat. Tony wipes his face, pulls on a pair of gloves as he goes to the furnace. He takes a white-hot piece of metal from the forge and starts pounding on it. Yinsen, soldering a complex circuit, looks up. He is struck by the image of Tony, strong and resolute, hammering away. SLOWLY PUSH IN ON - TONY: hammering away. YINSEN (O.S.) My people have a tale, about a Prince -- much hated by his King -- who was banished to the underworld and jailed there. BOOM! BOOM! The hammer blows ECHO. YINSEN (O.S.) The evil King gave him the most difficult labor -- working the iron pits. Tony's muscles ripple, sweat flying. YINSEN (O.S.) Year after year the Prince mined the heavy ore, becoming so strong he could crush pieces of it together with his bare hands. Too late, the King realized his mistake-- Dazzling sparks fly around Tony. YINSEN (O.S.) When he struck at the Prince with his finest sword -- it broke in half. The Prince himself had become strong as iron... Tony, sweating, holds up the metal he's been working on -- A crude iron mask stares back. He tosses the mask down. It lies there smoking and pulsing with heat. 40 INT. HALLWAY - STARK INTERNATIONAL HQ - DAY	40 From down the hallway, Pepper watches Obadiah and Rhodey in close, heavy conversation. Obadiah, grave, looks over and catches Pepper's eye, then he walks off, shaking his head. Rhodey on his way out. Pepper steps into his path."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,So that's it? Everyone's pulling the plug and moving on--
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,There's nothing left we can do. If there was any indication Tony was still alive--
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Spare me. I read the official e- mail. Thought maybe you'd have something different to say. Rhodey follows her into -- 41 INT. PEPPER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - DAY	41
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"If anyone could figure out how to beat the odds, it's Tony. If it was you over there, he'd be finding a way to get you back. Or inventing a new one."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,What do you want me to do?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Be a better friend to him. And with that, she storms out, leaving him stung. 42 EXT. EDWARDS A.F.B. - DAY	42 Rhodey, duffel slung in front of a C-17, is shipping out on a line of soldiers. General Gabriel pulls up on a golf cart and approaches. Everyone salutes. The General pulls Rhodey aside."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,GENERAL GABRIEL,"What do you think you're doing, Rhodes?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"Going back there, Sir."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,GENERAL GABRIEL,"Listen, son -- it's been three months without a single indication that Stark is still alive. We can't keep risking assets, least of all you."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"Are you blocking my transfer, Sir?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,GENERAL GABRIEL,(looking around) Any one of these guys would kill for your career. Are you telling me you're willing to sacrifice that to fly a bunch of snake-eaters on a desert patrol half way around the world?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"I am, Sir."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,GENERAL GABRIEL,Then I have one thing to say to you: Godspeed. He salutes Rhodey. Rhodey salutes back.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,GENERAL GABRIEL,"(to the soldiers) As you were. Rhodey turns and heads up the ramp into the loading bay. 43 INT. LAB - CAVE - WEEKS LATER - DAY	43 Tony puts the finishing touches on a strange box housing a laser-pointer, fan and tinsel. He tapes the box shut, peeks through a tiny hole in its side. TONY'S POV - INTO BOX: it looks like the furnace flames in the dark. 44 INT. RAZA'S CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT	44 Guards, bored and tired mill about.

Iron_Man_Full_Script,,NEW ANGLE,"A work-light is on, revealing Tony and Yinsen by the workbench. A sensor on Tony's leg is coupled to a contraption. Yinsen watches intently as -- Tony plugs a wire into his RT 'heart', a moment as -- Data races up on the crusty laptop then -- As Tony moves his leg, the contraption on the table springs to life, responding to his actions. Tony's chest-device, which dims with the power loss. The two men's eyes drift up and hold. Triumph."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,(unplugging himself) We're ready. A week of assembly and we're a go.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,Then perhaps it's time we settle another matter-- 46 INT. LAB - CAVE - DAY	46 Tony and Yinsen eat and play backgammon.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"Ah, anchoring with 13-7. You know, I have never met anyone who understands the nuances of this game like you."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Right back at ya.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"You never told me where you're from. A moment, then --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,I come from a small village not far from here. It was a good place... before these men ravaged it.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Do you have a family?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"When I get out of here, I am going to see them again. (then) Do you have family, Stark?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,--no.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,You're a man who has everything and nothing. Abu shouts from the door slat and enters.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"(in Arabic) Your laundry's over there. Abu goes to a basket where his laundry is neatly folded. He smells it, 'ah, clean clothes.' He heads for the door, shaking his head as he sees them play backgammon."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,ABU,(in Arabic) You idiots don't know what you're doing with that game.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Yeah-yeah, enjoy your laundry. Abu is about to head out when Raza enters. Abu freezes. Raza eyes's dip to the laundry, then without warning -- He shoots Abu in the head. Tony and Yinsen stand there, stock-still."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,"You have till tomorrow to assemble my missile. He walks out. His henchmen grab Abu's legs and drag him out. The silence hangs there, then -- 47 INT. RAZA'S CONTROL ROOM - CAVE - NEXT DAY - DAY	47 Guards pour over a map, discussing heatedly. Others clean and re-assemble weapons. Khalid keeps watch at the monitors.

Tony primes his flame throwers, but they malfunction. Both men square off. Raza aims, but now Tony's flame throwers kick in and Raza flattens as twin-plumes of fire envelope him. He SCREAMS, grabbing a dead soldiers as a shield. Tony turns clearing Insurgents out of the tunnels with his flame throwers. Then he returns to Yinsen."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,We could've made it. Both of us. You could've seen your family again.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"I am going to see them again. They're waiting for me. And now Tony understands Yinsen's family is dead. Yinsen grins, then sags into himself, dead. Rage overtakes Tony. He steams towards the exit, roaring. 67 EXT. EXIT TUNNEL - DAY	67 Raza's men fleeing as a deluge of flame shoots from the tunnel. Then -- Tony emerges, the gray armor scarred and sizzling. Insurgents keep firing, trying to draw him from the massive ammo dump under the camouflage. But Tony is relentless, keeps moving towards it. Tony turns his flame throwers on the crates. They begin to burn, the STARK logos eaten by flames. And now a withering barrage of gunfire knocks Tony to his knees. The hose to his flame thrower is pierced, setting his arm on fire. Another bullet catches a seam and enters his shoulder. But Tony struggles back to his feet. The suit GRINDS. He pushes further into the maze, torching everything. More gunfire pings and ricochets off him, pieces of the gray armor begins to come loose. Now Tony opens a metal flap on his arm, flips a red switch. And now something incredible happens A WHINE builds to a ROAR. Tony tucks, angles forward as heel-boosters glow white hot, kicking up desert plumes and then he blasts off like a missile, rising hundreds of feet. One Insurgent watches dumbstruck, as Tony arcs across the sky towards a mountain pass. And then the first ammo dump ignites. Then another and another, fire roses joining in a hellish conflagration. And barely outpacing the fireball -- 68 EXT. SKY - CONTINUOUS - DAY	68 The gray armor shoots towards us. Tony clears the mountain ridge by inches, and then -- His boosters are suddenly spent.

He falls, gets up again, keeps moving. 70 EXT. SAND DUNES - DUSK - NIGHT	70 Tony staggers down a dune, dying from thirst. Behind him a USAF Blackhawk suddenly rises over the lip of the dune.

Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"Saving your ass is getting to be a full time job. 71 EXT. EDWARDS A.F.B. - DAY	71 In the heat shimmers, a hulking form becomes a taxiing C-17. 72 EXT. EDWARD`S A.F.B. NEW ANGLE - MINUTES LATER - DAY	72 The rear ramp of the C-17 comes down. Light blinds Rhodey and Tony who's in a wheelchair. TONY'S POV: Pepper is revealed as the ramp lands. Rhodey wheels him down. As they reach the ramp's end--"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Help me out of this thing-- He struggles to his feet, faltering. Rhodey steadies him."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"I got you, pal. They walk together as Pepper comes forward. She meets eyes with Rhodey, and he nods to her."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Thank you. And now she faces Tony. A ghost of his former self, but she puts on a brave face."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,(managing a smile) Your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Tears of joy. I hate job hunting. Hogan comes around, holds the limo door open for Tony."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,HOGAN,"Good to see you again, Sir."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,You do something new with your hair?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,HOGAN,"Wouldn't dream of it, Sir. Pepper helps Tony into the limo. 73 INT. ROLLS SILVER PHANTOM - IDLING - DAY	73 Awkward silence. Pepper meets eyes with Hogan in the mirror."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,HOGAN,"Where to, Mr. Stark?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,We're due at the hospital.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"No -- to the office. (then) I've been in captivity for three months. There's only two things I want to do. I want to eat a cheeseburger. And I want to hold a press conference. Off Pepper's stunned look-- 74	74 Tony's limo pulls up, Hogan lets Tony out. He finishes a cheeseburger and Hogan takes the wrappers. Obadiah is waiting there with a group of gathered employees. They all start applauding. Obadiah with arms outstretched--"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"See this. Huh. Huh. He hugs Tony warmly, speaks close."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"Tony, thought we were meeting at the hospital. You know there's a lot of reporters in there. What's going on?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,You'll see. C'mon -- They head inside. 75 INT. STARK INDUSTRIES LOBBY - DAY	75 Packed with Reporters waiting for the hundred-carat headline. Pepper is approached by AGENT PHIL COULSON (40s).
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"You'll have to take a seat, Sir."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,COULSON,"Oh, I'm not a reporter. I'm Agent Phil Coulson with the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division--"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,That's a mouthful.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,COULSON,I know. Here. He hands her a card. She squints at the tiny font.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Look, Mr. Coulson, we've already spoken with the D.O.D., the FBI, the CIA--"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,COULSON,We're a separate division with a more...specific focus. We need to debrief Tony about the circumstances of his escape. More importantly--
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"(cutting him off) Well, great, I'll let him know--"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,COULSON,--we're here to help. We're here to listen. I assure you Mr. Stark will want to talk to us.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,I'm sure he will. Now if you could just take your seat.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,NEW ANGLE,"As Tony enters, struggling his way to the podium, followed by Obadiah. Tony gazes out over the reporters. Suddenly he seems vulnerable, scattered. The silence grows awkward. Obadiah is mercifully going to save him when --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"I-- can't do this anymore. Pregnant silence. Everyone waiting for the Stark punch-line. Finally, a Reporter ventures -- REPORTER # 1 You mean you're retiring?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"No, I don't want to retire. I want to do something else. The room waits through more awkward silence, then -- REPORTER # 1 Something besides weapons?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Yes. That's right. The room is suddenly BUZZING with overlapping questions -- REPORTER #2 The official report was sketchy. What happened to you over there, Mr. Stark? Tony is pensive, then the floodgates open."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"What happened over there? I had my eyes opened, that's what happened. I saw my weapons, with my name on them, in the hands of thugs. I thought we were doing good here-- I can't say that anymore. Rhodey, just arriving in the rear, pulls up to Pepper."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"Uhh, weren't we taking him to the hospital? Pepper is transfixed. Nearby, Agent Coulson watches stoically. REPORTER #2 What do you intend to do about it, Mr. Stark?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"The system is broken -- there's no accountability whatsoever. Right now, as of this second, we are freezing the sale of all Stark weaponry worldwide. Now the room is in chaos. Obadiah's ready to wrap this up, and moves towards Tony."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,We've lost our way. I need to re- evaluate things. And my heart's telling me I have more to offer the planet than things that blow up. REPORTER #3 So you're saying...what are you saying?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"(arm around Stane) In the coming months, Mr. Stane here and I will set a new course for Stark Industries. ""Tomorrow Today"" has always been our slogan. It's time we try to live up to it. The questions are now firing in a CACOPHONY. Obadiah takes the podium."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"Okay, I think we're going to be selling a lot of newspapers here. What we should take away from this is that Tony's back, he's healthier than ever, and as soon as he heals up and takes some time off, we're going to have a little internal discussion and get back to you. Thank you for coming by. Tony steps down, exhilarated. He works his way through the swarming reporters, approaching Rhodey and Pepper -- who have stunned looks on their faces."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,You mean that? Or is this some clever stock-maneuver?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Wait and see. 76	76 Stane approaches Tony, who stares at the Arc Reactor while eating fries and sipping a Coke."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,Well that went well. You just painted targets on our heads. Our stock is going to take a 40 point dive tomorrow. Tony says nothing.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"(considers a new tact) Tony, we are a weapon`s manufacturer. Turning this company around to make baby bottles is like trying to get a bear to walk on its hind legs."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,I don't want a body count to be my only legacy. There are other things we can do.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,Like what?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,We could develop the Arc Reactor. Obadiah points to the Arc.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"This? This was a publicity stunt. It's not even cost effective. We knew that before we built it. Repulsor technology is a dead end. Tony rips open his shirt, revealing the glowing RT."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,No it isn't.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,(touching the RT) Oh my God. It is a miracle you are alive. What must have happened to you over there? (hugs Tony) We're a team. There is nothing we can't do if we stick together -- like your father and I. Let me handle this. But you have to lay low. Don't talk to the press again. Can you do that for me?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Yes. Thanks Obie. 77 INT. TONY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT	77 As Tony enters, the house comes alive. Windows and lights change colors. The TV turns on. Jarvis loading all of Tony's preferences."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,JARVIS,"Hello, Mr. Stark."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Hello, Jarvis."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,JARVIS,What can I do for you?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,--I need to build a better heart.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,JARVIS,"I'm not sure I follow, Sir."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Give me a scan and you'll see. 78 INT. TONY'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT	78 Tony, shirtless and wearing goggles, sits in the 3D laser scanner. Lasers play over him, mapping his entire body."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,JARVIS,What were your intentions for this device? MONITORS: terabytes of data race past.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,It powers an electromagnet which keeps the shrapnel from entering my heart. Can you recommend any upgrades?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,JARVIS,It is difficult to offer counsel in light of the fact that your stated intentions are inconsistent with your actions. MONITOR: Tony's chest device magnified. Its various components flashing as Jarvis analyzes them.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,What are you talking about? That is ridiculous. That is exactly the purpose of this invention. MONITORS: going deeper and deeper through the strata of Tony's device. Like it's a city unto itself.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,JARVIS,"The energy yeild of this device outperforms your stated intention by eleven orders of magnitude. You could accomplish your stated goal with the power output of a car battery. Tony steps from the booth. All around him, calculations flash at blinding speed."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Upgrade recommendations. List.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,JARVIS,Why are you talking to me like a computer?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Because you are acting like one.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,JARVIS,Shall I disable random pattern conversation?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,No. It's ok. You are the only one who understands me.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,JARVIS,I don't understand you sir.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Were you always this dry? I remember you having more personality than this.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,JARVIS,Should I activate sarcasm harmonics?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Fine. Could you please make your recommendations now?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,JARVIS,It would thrill me to no end.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Ahh that's more like it.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,JARVIS,Should I begin machining the parts?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Machine away. VARIOUS SHOTS: Tony loads raw metal stock onto a lathe and begins cutting. A robot arm organizes pieces of cut stock. The CNC Machine comes to life and begins milling parts. 79 EXT. SAND DUNES - AFGHANISTAN - DAY	79 Metal fingers protrude from the sand. A filthy human hand reaches into frame, freeing a metal gauntlet from the desert floor. Then, we reveal horses and old pickups, scattered as men scavenge among the dunes. A Toyota pickup flies the banner of the Ten Rings. A burly man, his back to us, leans on the bed- mounted machine- gun. As we TRACK around him we can see it's Raza, his terrible scars still raw from Iron Man's flame- thrower. He swats flies from his wounds. In one hand Raza holds Tony's battered helmet, staring into its eyelets."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,"(subtitled) Keep looking. I want all of it. 80 INT. TONY'S BEDROOM - DAY	80 Knocks on the door, enters. The bed is untouched. The flat screen TV is on Jim Cramer delivering a sermon."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CRAMER,"Stark International: I've got one recommendation. Ready? SEELLLL! Abandon ship! Does the Hindenburg ring any bells? Cramer pushes one of his big red buttons, and we hear the sounds of SHRIEKING. Pepper shuts it off as she talks on the phone and heads out to. 81 INT. TONY'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY	81 Pepper clicks on her headset. COULSON (O.S.) Hello. This is Agent Coulson with Strategic Homeland Inter-"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,(cutting him off) Yes. I remember. What can I do for you?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,INTERCUT - PHIL COULSON'S OFFICE - SAME TIME,"A plain government-issue office. On his desk, newspapers with headlines: ""STARK RAVING MAD?"" ""STARK LUNACY""."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,COULSON,I've left a number of messages trying to get something on the books with Mr. Stark.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,I know this is a priority for him. The next few weeks are a bit up in the air and I can't set appointments without speaking with him first.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,COULSON,Do you know when you will be speaking with him again?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Not Sure.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,INTERCUT - TONY'S LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME,Pepper is interrupted by the intercom. It's Tony-- TONY (O.S.) Pepper? How big are your hands?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,COULSON,What was that?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Agent Coulson, I really have to go. Let me get back to you later. She hangs up."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,(then to the vox) What? TONY (O.S.) How big are your hands?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"I don't under-- TONY (O.S.) -- just get down here. 82 INT. TONY'S WORKSHOP - SECONDS LATER - DAY	82 Dim and unsettling. She finds Tony shirtless in a chair, she sees his chest device for the first time and steels herself."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Show me your hands.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,What?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Just show me your hands. She does.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Perfect, they're small. I need you to help me."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,(re: heart) So that's the thing that's keeping you alive.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"That's the thing that was keeping me alive. It is now an antique. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future. He hold up the newly fabricated, higher tech replacement chest piece."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Amazing.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,I'm going to swap them out and switch all functions to the new unit.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Is it safe?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Completely. First I need you to reach in and--
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,(off-put) Reach in to where?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,The socket.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,What socket?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"The chest socket. Listen carefully, because we have to do this in a matter of minutes."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Or else what?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,I can go into cardiac arrest.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,I thought you said it was safe.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,I didn't want you to panic.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Oh my god--
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Stay with me. I need you to relieve the pressure on my myocardial nerve.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,I don't know how to do that.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,I'm telling you.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Sorry--
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Listen. I'm going to lift off the old chest piece--
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Won't that make you die?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Not immediately. When I lift it off I need you to reach into the socket as far as your hand can fit and gently move the housing away from my heart. Do you know which direction that is?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,To the right.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,To my right. Your left.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,To the left.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Right.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Left.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Right. Left. Pepper begins to reach in.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,How deep does this go?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Keep going. She reaches uncomfortably deep.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,That's it. Deeper. Now press. Yes. It's releasing. She pulls her hand out covered in a nasty pink slime.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Ew!!! Pus!
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"It's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge. It's from the device, not my body."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Well it smells. Am I done?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Yes. Thank you.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Can I wash my hands now? She walks to the sink as Tony drops a drain into the opening.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,The new unit is much more efficient. This shouldn't happen again.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Good, cause it's not in my job description."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,It is now.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,I don't suppose you want to go over things? The robot arm sets in the new heart piece.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Can it at least wait until I install my new untested ground- breaking self-contained power source and lifesaving device prototype?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,I suppose. She examines the old chest piece.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Throw that thing out.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Don't you want to save it?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Why? It's antiquated.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,You made it out of spare parts in a dungeon. It saved your life. Doesn't it at least have some nostalgic value?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Pepper. I have been called many things. Nostalgic is not one of them. The new chest lights brightly.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,There. Good as new. Thank you.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,You're welcome. Can I ask you a favor?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Shoot.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"I don't do well under that kind of pressure. If you need someone to do something like that again, get somebody else."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,I don't have anyone else. They share a rare moment without words. A smile?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Will that be all, Mr. Stark?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"That will be all, Ms. Potts. She exits. He watches, then stands up. A83 INT. TONY'S WORKSHOP - DAYS LATER - DAY A83 Sketches and diagrams splayed on the worktable. Tony finishes soldering work on two sculpted metal boots. Monitors flicker behind him, the robot arm ""looks"" over his shoulder. JARVIS (O.S.) Still having trouble walking, Sir?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"These aren't for walking. 84 INT. TONY`S WORKSHOP - NEW ANGLE - LATER - DAY	84 Tony, finishes marking a 'test circle' with pieces of tape. He's now wearing the boots, wired to a chest 'bandolier'."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Ready to record the big moment, Jarvis?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,JARVIS,"All sensors ready, Sir."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"We'll start off easy. Ten percent. Tony activates hand-controlled joysticks. He shoots up, flips over and out of frame. Crashes. After a beat-- JARVIS (O.S.) That flight yielded excellent data, Sir."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Great. I, uhh, think I know what this needs. 85 INT. HANGAR - EDWARDS A.F.B. - DAY	85 Rhodey paces before an F-22 and a Global Hawk drone. Student Pilots are assembled before him."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"Manned or unmanned, which is the future of air combat? For my money, no drone, no computer will ever trump a pilot's instincts. His reflexes, his judgement-- A VOICE chimes in from the depths-- VOICE (O.S.) Why not take it a step further?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,NEW ANGLE,Tony's been watching from the shadows.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Why not-- a pilot without the plane?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,That I'd like to see. (then) Look who fell out of the sky--
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,(to the pilots) Who wants to take these apart and put them back together?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"(to the pilots) All right -- let's wrap it up. Tony walks to Rhodey as the pilots trickle out, buzzing and stealing looks at Tony."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,I didn't think I'd be seeing you for a while.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Why not?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,Figured you'd need a little time.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Why does everybody think I need time?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"You've been through a lot, thought you should get your head straight."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,I've got it straight. And I'm back to work.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,Really?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,I'm onto something big. I want you to be a part of it.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,Lot of people around here will be happy to hear that. What you said at that press conference really threw everyone.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,I mean what I said.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,No you don't. You took a bad hit. It spun you around. It hangs. Then--
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Maybe I do need a little time.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,All right then. Good seeing you.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Likewise. Tony walks from the hangar. Rhodey watches him go. 86 INT. TONY'S WORKSHOP - DAYS LATER - NIGHT	86 Tony tests out the prototype of a gauntlet. Clips the gauntlet wires to the chest bandolier. He extends his arm, lets off a burst of RT from his palm, it tips over a toolbox, scattering wrenches. Pepper, who's been watching in the b.g., approaches."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Thought you were done with weapons.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,It's a flight-stabilizer.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Well, watch where you're pointing your ""fight-stabilizer"", would you? (then) Obadiah's upstairs -should I tell him you're in?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Be right up. She leaves a small package on a worktable and departs. Tony turns, spotting the box. Intrigued, he tears it open to find his old chest-device, mounted in Lucite, glowing faintly. It's inscribed: PROOF THAT TONY STARK HAS A HEART-- He smiles. 87 INT. TONY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT	87 Obadiah sets a pizza down on the table. Tony paces, full of manic energy."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,This -- this is the big-big idea. It can pull the company in a whole new direction.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"That's great. Get me the design as soon as you can. We've got a hungry production line that knock out a prototype in days. Tony looks at Obadiah, getting emotional."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"You know, I had a moment there where I was reluctant but I know now I made the best decision. I feel like I'm doing something-- right, finally. (meaning it) Thank you for supporting me in this. Obadiah nods, touched, then --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"Listen, I have something to talk to you about. I really wish you'd attended the last board meeting like I asked you to."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"I know, I'm sorry. What did I miss?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,The board's filed an injunction against you.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,What?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,They claim you're unfit to run the company and want to lock you out.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,How the hell can they do that? It's my name on the building! My ideas that drive that company.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"They're going to try. We'll fight them, of course."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,With the amount of stocks we own I thought we controlled the company.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"I don't know. Somehow they pulled enough votes together. Listen, the world doesn't share your vision, Tony. The more people have to lose, the more frightened they are of new ideas. He pours two drinks. Tony declines."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"Now listen, I don't want you to get all in knots. You know how many times I protected your father from the wolves? Tony nods, still troubled."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"Get back to your lab and work some magic. You let me handle the board. Oh and Tony, no more press conferences. 88 INT. TONY'S WORKSHOP - DAYS LATER - DAY	88 Tony's suit is now comprised of a stabilizer belt, partially- chromed propulsion boots and the Mark II gauntlets. Everything connected by tubing and wires, he looks like a crazy science experiment. Tony fires up the boots, hovers. Then he fires the gloves to stabilize. Weaving, tilting. He ""surfs"" mid-air, trying to maintain balance, slowly getting the hang of it. Then he ventures forward, moving along the expanse of the lab. Dodging pieces of equipment, his car collection, a few near misses but he maintains control. Debris and objects are blown from tables from the propulsive force. The joy of flight."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Nothing to it-- He cuts the propulsion and lands. Looks to Jarvis.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"All right. Let's get to work. We PULL BACK out of a dark hole in the chest-plate of Tony's original gray armor and show the whole battered suit, being pieced together by Raza's men. Then we -- 89 INT. TENT - NIGHT	89 Raza, his face healed now, watching the armor coming together, mesmerized. 90 INT. TONY'S WORKSHOP - A WEEK LATER - NIGHT	90 A humanoid form walks out, shrouded in shadow. Then, ceiling lights CLUNK on, one-by-one, revealing --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CLOSER - DIFFERENT ANGLES,"Powerful scaly arms and legs. Steel vertebrae. The intense glow of Tony's RT ""heart"" through the chestpiece. Ailerons and air brakes pop up as Tony moves his head and arms, ""stretching"", getting the feel for his new body. The helmet, its intrepid, steely gaze boring into us. Now we see the full-on Mark II suit, its seams and rivets still visible. The suit HUMS as it powers up."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Standby for calibration. The gauntlets and boots fire up, and Tony rises. Suddenly--"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Whoa-- He loses balance, falls back onto the hood of his Saleen, crushing it. The ALARM goes off. Tony kills the alarm with a blast of RT."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,We should take this outside. JARVIS (O.S.) I must strongly caution against that. There are terabytes of calculations still needed --
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"We'll do them in-flight. JARVIS (O.S.) Sir, the suit has not even passed a basic wind-tunnel test."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,That's why you're coming with me.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,"TONY'S POV - THE ""HEADS-UP DISPLAY""","The HUD comes alive as Jarvis ""loads"" into the suit's on- board system. Tony fires boots and gauntlets again. He hovers, floating along the workshop's driveway. JARVIS (O.S.) I suggest you allow me to employ Directive Four."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Never interrupt me while I'm with a beautiful woman? JARVIS (O.S.) That's Directive Six. Directive Four: use any and all means to protect your life should you be incapable of doing so.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Whatever floats you, Jarvis. 91 EXT. SKY - NIGHT	91 Tony tumbles around the sky, trying to control his flight. 92 INT. IRON MAN SUIT - NIGHT	92 TONY'S POV: his ""display"" glows in front of us: altitude, power, vital signs. Beyond that the live horizon spins and jiggles out of control. CUT TO: 93 EXT. SKY - NIGHT	93 Tony tucks his arms and legs tight, thrusts his chest, eventually finding the Delta Pose. And suddenly he's in control. He pulls a few turns, and swishes along the ribbon of headlights on the PCH. Then he carves a turn out over the ocean, dives. Whooping like a kid on a coaster. The waves flash by fifty feet below and returning to shore, he arcs into a high performance climb, passing the Santa Monica Pier and sees a Kid on the Ferris wheel spotting him. Eyes wide -- FLASH TO - KID'S POV: as Iron Man zips past. CUT TO: 94 EXT. SKY FROM ABOVE A CLOUD - NIGHT	94 A glow, then Tony shoots out and keeps ascending; a steel Icarus reaching for the heavens. CLOSE ON - TONY'S MASK: ice crystals forming. JARVIS (O.S.) Power: fifteen percent. Recommend you descend and re-charge, Sir. But Tony isn't listening. JARVIS (O.S.) Acknowledge, Mr. Stark-- CUT TO: Tony, intoxicated, as the moon beckons, impossibly bright. TONY'S DISPLAY: as all indicators begin flashing red. JARVIS (O.S.) Power at five percent. Threshold breached -- A POP then everything goes dark. Tony is yanked from his reverie. His display flashes: ""SYSTEM SHUT-DOWN""."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Uhh, Jarvis? JARVIS --? The glow gone from his chest, the suit a dead hull. The world starts to pinwheel outside. CUT TO: Tony, plummeting back to Earth in a free fall. Piercing the clouds, surging towards the L.A. grid."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"STATUS, STATUS! REBOOT -- Then: another POP, and a SURGE. The heads-up display flickers back to life, the suit's power returns. JARVIS (O.S.) Temporary power restored. Descend immediately. Tony works the boosters, to get the suit back under control."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Jarvis, I think we need to chat about, uh, Directive Four. JARVIS (O.S.) May I remind you, the suit feeds off the same power source as your life-support. A zero-drain of RT will likely kill you."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"You're a downer, Jarvis. But I appreciate the heads-up. CUT TO: Tony, as he descends towards his estate grounds. He attempts an elegant landing stance, but can't quite hold it -- JARVIS (O.S.) Shall I take over?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"No, I got it, I got it -- He punches through the roof of his mansion. 95 INT. TONY'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT	95 He plunges through the foyer ceiling-- 96 INT.

He unlatches his helmet and yanks it off, all the CAR ALARMS blaring around him."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Perfect. Let's do some upgrades. 97 INT. LAB - LATER	97 Tony's out of the suit, which hangs nearby. He's jazzed up, typing fast on his terminal. The screens are alive with scrolling data, graphics and diagnostic tests. The plasma TV is on low in the b.g. JARVIS (O.S.) That was quite dangerous, Sir. Might I remind you, if the suit loses power, so does your heart."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Yeah, and it doesn't have a seat belt either. A few issues: main transducer felt sluggish at plus forty altitude. Same goes for hull pressurization. I'm thinking icing might be a factor. JARVIS (O.S.) The suit isn't rated for high altitude. You're expending eight percent power just heating and pressurizing."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Re-configure using the gold- titanium alloy from the Seraphim Tactical Satellite. It should ensure fuselage integrity to 50 thousand feet, while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. JARVIS (O.S.) Shall I render, utilizing proposed specifications?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Wow me. On the center screen, the Mark III prototype is being ""built"" by Jarvis. The final product appears: an all-gold version of the Mark III. Tony regards it."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Hm. Bit ostentatious, don't you think? He looks over at -- His hot-rod and motorcycle."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Add a little red, would you? Tony's distracted by the TV. Local entertainment Reporter standing outside Disney Hall. He grabs a remote, turns it up."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,REPORTER,"Tonight's Red-Hot Red Carpet is here at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, where Tony Stark's third annual benefit for the Firefighter Family Fund has become the go-to charity gala on L.A.'s high-society calendar.

Iron_Man_Full_Script,,REPORTER,"--the man whose name graces the gold-lettered invitations hasn't been seen in public since his highly controversial press conference, and rumors abound. Some say Stark is suffering from post traumatic stress and hasn't left his bed in weeks. Tony returns his attention to the -- COMPUTER MONITOR: the red and gold Mark III revealed. JARVIS (O.S.) The work could take till morning to complete, Sir."

DISNEY CONCERT HALL - NIGHT	98 A fire-truck is parked outside. Obadiah poses for photos on the red carpet. The crowd is a mix of kingmakers, pols and Generals -- along with celebs and stars. Suddenly, all the cameras swing over to Tony, decked out, exiting his Audi R8. He sees a white-haired man in a red smoking jacket, drowning between three hot Women. Tony slaps him on the back."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Eyyy, there he is. My man! The man turns, it's not Hugh Hefner, but Stan Lee."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Sorry, thought you were someone else. Tony strides up to Obadiah, puts his arm around him and poses for photos."

Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Oh-- was I supposed to meet you here?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,COULSON,"No, but you haven't been returning my calls. This is serious, we need to get something on the books or I'll have to go official on you. Tony sees Pepper coming down the stairs. She looks stunning in a classic gown."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Yes, you're right. I'm going to handle this right now. Let me check with my assistant. Tony beelines for Pepper. She's surprised to see him."

Oh, no, no-- I'm not saying, like, ""wedding."" No, not like that. I'm just saying, you know-- He plants one on her. She gets quiet. They both do. Then--"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Can I get you another glass of wine?

Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CHRISTINE,Mr. Stark! I was hoping I could get that reaction from you.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,How's panic?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CHRISTINE,I was referring to your company's involvement in this latest atrocity.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Hey, they just put my name on the invitations -- She thrusts a dossier of photos out to him."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CHRISTINE,"Is this what you call accountability? He looks at the photos, going stone-faced."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,When were these taken?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CHRISTINE,"Yesterday. Good P.R. move, you tell the world you're a changed man, even I believed you. THE PHOTOS: victorious insurgents, the Ten Rings insignia on their vehicles, clutch Stark machine guns, RPGs. Behind, a town burns, bodies strewn. A photo of civilians being marched in rows, pre-execution, Stark weapons trained at their backs."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,I didn't approve this shipment.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,CHRISTINE,Well your company did.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Come with me. He leaves, making a bee line for-- 102 EXT. DISNEY CONCERT HALL - MINUTES LATER - NIGHT 102 Tony strides out to the red-carpet paparazzi."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"I made some promises I'm not going to be able to keep. I suggest you pull all your money out of Stark Industries immediately -- Obadiah is suddenly there, steering Tony up the entrance stairs."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"Is this like a tick for you? Whenever you have a feeling, you start going to all the people who don't trust you, who don't protect you. They're going to put a spin on everything you say."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Wait a minute. I got to ask you something. I'm dead serious about this. I'm not kidding. Am I losing my mind or is Pepper really cute? Do you think she's attractive and interesting, or is it just that her hair is down? I've been out of the game for a while."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"Are you out of your mind. You're messing with the ""guys in the rooms"", we're talking about billion dollar interests, the world order - -"

Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,Tony don't be so naive --
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"-- naive? I was naive before, when I was growing up and they told me don't ever cross this line, this is how we do business. In the meantime we're double-dealing under the table. We don't even deserve to represent the United States --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"-- Tony, you're a child --!"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"-- you don't believe I can turn this company around, do you --?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,-- you've got about as much control over things as a child riding in the backseat of your father's car with a red plastic steering wheel in your hand.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Maybe I'll just get out of the car.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"You're not even allowed in the car. (then) I'm the one who's filing the injunction against you. Tony is shell-shocked. Then, he goes after Obadiah. They jostle and Obadiah backs off as Tony goes ballistic. The paparazzi snap photos."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"It's the only way I could protect you. Aki (from earlier) and several Obadiah's Men, smiling, but steely-eyed, step in to prevent Tony from following Obadiah to his waiting car."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"(yelling after Obadiah) This is going to stop. CUT TO: 103 INT. TONY'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT 103 Tony, wearing a Mark III gauntlet, wired to his RT chest- piece, turns a screwdriver to adjust the power. On the wall beside him a flat screen TV: live war footage, refugees huddled. The bottom crawl reads, ""BREAKING NEWS - TRAGEDY IN GULMIRA."" TV REPORTER'S VOICE the ten mile drive to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described as a descent into Hell, into a modern-day Heart of Darkness. Simple farmers and herders, from peaceful villages, driven from their homes at the butt of Western rifles and the turrets of modern tanks. Displaced from their lands by Warlords and insurgent groups emboldened by their newfound power, a power fueled by high-tech weapons easily purchased with Poppy money on the black market and further destabilizing a fragile region which for decades has been a tinderbox of tribal feuding and ethnic hatred. Tony aims the gauntlet at some light fixtures. Gives them an RT blast. They spark and fall from the ceiling."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TV REPORTER'S VOICE,"The villagers have taken shelter in whatever crude dwellings they can find -- in the ruins of other razed villages, in the cold barren scrublands, or in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant. Our translator relayed to us one human tragedy after another. A seven year old boy, thin as a scarecrow,clutching yellowed photographs and holding them out to anyone who would stop, with a child's simple question: where are my mother and father? A woman, begging for news of her husband, who'd been kidnapped by insurgents, either forced to join their militia, or to be shot without reason. Tony adjusts the gauntlet again, raising the power level. Blasts a window in the lab, shattering the glass and knocking a painting off the wall."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TV REPORTER'S VOICE,"With no political will or international pressure, there is little hope for these newly-formed refugees. Refugees who can only wonder one thing: is the world watching? A final adjustment. Another RT blast, this time Tony wipes out the plasma TV screen. 104 INT. TONY`S WORKSHOP NEW ANGLE - MINUTES LATER 104 Pepper enters, regards the destruction, the massive hole in the ceiling, then Tony. He is stoic."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Are you going to tell me what's going on?

THEIR POV - OF 'ALLEY' OUTSIDE: an abandoned industrial facility. GUNFIRE, SCREAMING. In the distance ragged tents and shanties are beset upon by black clad Irregular Forces, firing and burning and destroying. Soldiers toss grenades into rat holes. Hunter-killer teams fire at offscreen targets then smile with satisfaction. The oldest of the four kids in the crawlspace darts out into the alley, frantically calling -- KID Arto! ARTO! On his way back he's surprised by a four man hunter-killer team. They shout at him to drop the puppy, but he won't. The men cock their guns, briefly distracted by a strange rocket-streak in the sky. Never mind, they take aim on the boy, and are about to fire when IRON MAN lands before them, slamming his fist to the ground in the classic Granov fist smash. With a single RT blast the Soldiers are thrown fifty yards. Tony scoops up the Kid, with the barking mutt in his arms, and they take off."

He sees a soldier flying like a ragdoll from behind a heap of bricks. The Boy moves for a better view and sees Iron Man in full terrible glory, deflecting withering fire while laying waste to a cluster of militants with his fists and bursts of RT. Refugees slowly emerge from their cover, stunned to watch Soldiers retreating in fear. CUT TO: Raza, his wounds healed like papier-m�ch�, observing his retreating men from a command post. He grabs a rifle, steps through a building, and spots Iron Man, in the distance, throwing a Soldier through a wall. Raza scrunches into nook, riveted.

He identifies its weak spot, then -- CUT TO: A forearm panel pops open on Tony's suit, revealing a mini- missile pod. He fires and the missile nails the weak spot. A chain reaction, then the tank explodes, raining debris. Then Tony is surprised from behind. He whirls, brandishing his glowing palm.

TONY'S DUBAI VILLA - ALCOVE - SAME TIME - DAY 121 Pepper sitting on a small bench, head propped in her hand, having dozed off. A WHOOSH and a streak flashes outside the window, startling her awake. Pepper rises, looking around, then exits frame -- 122 INT. TONY'S DUBAI VILLA - SITTING ROOM - MINUTES LATER - DAY 122 Pepper enters, cautiously, moving towards something in the shadows. We hinge as she passes us, to REVEAL Tony, sitting in a huge chair, the armor scarred and still smoking. Helmet off, bleeding from the nose and ears. A drink in one shaky hand."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Get me home-- 123 EXT. SNOW-COVERED WASTELAND - OUTSKIRTS OF GULMIRA - NIGHT 123 A few yurts. Raza's bivouacked men lick their battle wounds. A devastated band. They grab their guns and stand-to as a train of black Suburbans arrive. Private Security Guards exit and take up positions. Then the scarred Raza saunters out of a yurt and goes to the lead Suburban. Its door opens and out steps Obadiah Stane gazes about, unfazed, then --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,Welcome. Obadiah assesses the scars on Raza's face.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,Compliments of Tony Stark.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"If you'd killed him when you were supposed to, you'd still have a face."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,"You paid us trinkets to kill a prince. An insult, to me and the man whose ring I wear. CLOSE ON - RAZA'S RING: the familiar ten interlocked rings."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,I think it's best we don't get him involved in this. (then) I've come a long way to see this weapon. Show me.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,"Come. Leave your guards outside. 124 INT. RAZA'S YURT - NIGHT 124 Obadiah enters and stares down, transfixed. STANE'S POV: THE REASSEMBLED GRAY ARMOR suspended on wires."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,His escape bore unexpected fruit.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,(as it dawns on him) --so this is how he did it.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,This is only a crude first effort. But he's perfected his design-- Raza hands grainy surveillance photos to Stane. CLOSE ON - VARIOUS PHOTOS: Iron Man wreaking havoc in Gulmira. Stane has seen the future. Then he looks down at -- Tony's crusty laptop. The onion-skin schematics.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,What's this?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,"The inside of Tony Stark's mind. Raza arranges the schematics on a light board, and the sketches laid together become-- Iron Man."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,"Everything you will need to build this weapon. Obadiah is circling the armor now, taking it all in. Raza sits and pours tea."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,Stark has made a masterpiece of death. A man with a dozen of these could rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine. And you dream of Stark's throne -- we have a common enemy. Now Stane pokes at the vacant hole in the chest plate.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RAZA,"If we are back in business, I give you these designs as my gift. In turn, I hope you will repay me with a gift of iron soldiers. Obadiah smiles, places his hands on Raza's shoulders, as if going to hug him in brotherhood."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"(in perfect Urdu) This-- is the only gift you shall receive. Raza is strangely confused. Paralyzed. Blood begins running from his ear. And now, in Obadiah's hand, we realize he's holding a device. A sonic taser. Obadiah removes a pair of filtering ear-plugs as Raza crumples to the dirt."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"Technology -- (holds up the taser) it's always been your Achilles Heel. Don't worry, it'll wear off in fifteen minutes -- but that's the least of your problems. Obadiah removes Raza's ring, studies it. Then he turns and exits-- 125 EXT. RAZA'S YURT - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 125 As he steps out of the tent, Obadiah sees by the Suburbans, Raza's men kneel, guns to their heads."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,(to head guard) Crate up that armor and the rest of it. We TRACK WITH Obadiah as he passes Raza's kneeling men.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,Send them to their virgins. The SOUND of MACHINE GUN FIRE. Obadiah does not flinch. 126 INT. PHIL COULSON'S OFFICE - DAY 126 Phil Coulson at his desk. He picks up the phone and dials.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,COULSON,"Ms. Potts. It's Agent Coulson from the Strategic Homeland Inter-- PEPPER (O.S.) Yes, I know. Unfortunately Tony is not going to be available to sit down with you for a while."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,COULSON,"Really? And why is that? PEPPER (O.S.) He's uh, there's a-- Tony won't be- -"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,COULSON,Maybe I can meet with you instead?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Why? I don't know anything. COULSON (O.S.) About what?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,About anything. There's a BUZZ. Pepper eyes the security monitor and sees Rhodey.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,Pepper. It's Rhodey.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,(pressing a button) Come in. COULSON (O.S.) I'd just like to ask you a few questions.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"I'm really jammed right now. Booked solid for the next few weeks. I have to go. Rhodey enters, grim."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,COULSON,"Let's just put something on the books. How about (checks his calendar) the twenty-eighth? Seven PM, at Stark Industries?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Great. Perfect. Bye. She hangs up.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,How's he doing?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Not so good.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,I want to see him.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"You can't see him right now. Rhodey eyes the hole in the ceiling, worried now."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"What the hell is going on here? (off her silence) Let me in there, Pepper. She faces off with him. Then allows him by."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"You want to see him? Fine. See what you've done to him. 127 INT. TONY'S BEDROOM - STARK ESTATE - MINUTES LATER 127 Tony lies in bed, tethered to all sorts of medical equipment. Rhodey enters, stunned at Tony's state. Pulls up a chair and sits. Tony drifts in and out of consciousness."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,Look at you-- what were you thinking?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Weapons I built are being used to kill innocent people. Can't let that happen anymore.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,You can't go around and blow up stuff every time you see something you don't like on TV.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Yes I can.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"You got lucky, next time they'll blow you to pieces."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Next time, maybe I won't play defense. Rhodey, floored, gets to his feet. Paces."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"Does Pepper know about this? He nods, his eyes starting to flicker."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,You've put me in a tough spot here. What am I supposed to do?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,That's up to you. I've made my choice -- I'm not going to sit on the sidelines anymore -- I'm going to fight for what's right.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,Don't you get it? It's not up to us to decide.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"That's where you're wrong-- He drifts into unconsciousness. 128 INT.SUB-BASEMENT PIPE ROOM - STARK INTERNATIONAL HQ - DAY 128 Windowless and full of pipes. The Mark I armor, dissected into its pieces, hovers mid air, suspended by wires. Elite Engineers from the Stark empire are hard at work, milling and machining armored parts. Obadiah walks among them."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"Civilization, gentlemen, has been preserved by the right people having the right idea at the right time. You are shaping in your hands, this very moment, the future of this company, and this nation. But it is imperative this project remain data-masked, that it's existence never leave these walls. Make no mistake -- this is a 'tool', that in wrong hands, could jeopardize civilization as we know it. Obadiah faces the Head Engineer."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,HEAD ENGINEER,"Give us full access to the Sampson Cluster, and we'll have you a prototype in record time."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"The Sampson's yours. We go 24-7. 129 EXT. CAVE - AFGHANISTAN - DAY 129 Yinsen, framed by the mountains in the b.g., stares at us."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,YINSEN,"Are you on the right path? I don't know-- what does your heart tell you, Stark? HOLD on Yinsen, then -- CUT TO: 130 INT. TONY'S BEDROOM - DAY 130 Tony waking up in his gilded bedroom, alone. He catches his own sad reflection in a mirror. Hooked up to IVs and machinery that PINGS and HISSES. 131 INT. TONY'S BEDROOM - DAY 131 Pepper enters and finds Tony's bed empty. 132 INT. TONY'S WORKSHOP - DAY 132 Pepper enters as Tony toils away at an eviscerated suit suspended from a chain winch."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,This device will hack into Stark Industries mainframe. I need you to go to there and retrieve all shipping manifests.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,What are you doing? Absolutely not you should be in bed--
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,--they've been dealing weapons under the table and I'm going to stop them.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Absolutely not. I'm not helping you with anything if you're going to start this again.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,There is nothing else. There's no art opening. There's no benefit. There's nothing to sign. There's no decisions to be made. There's the next mission and nothing else. There's nothing except this.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,I quit.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Really? You stood there by my side when all I did was reap the benefits of wholesale irresponsibility and destruction and now that I'm trying to right those wrongs and protect the people I put in harms way you're going to walk out on me.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,You're going to kill yourself. I can't support that.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"So far so good. (beat) Pepper. I know what I have to do. I don't know if I can, but I know in my heart that it's right. And you do too. And I can't do it without you. 133 INT. SUB-BASEMENT PIPE ROOM - SAME TIME - DAY 133 Obadiah, next to his Head Engineer. Behind them are the hulking steel legs of the Dynamo, extending out of frame. The sparks from a welding gun shower down."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,HEAD ENGINEER,There's no technology that can power this thing.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"I told you, miniaturize the ARK reactor."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,HEAD ENGINEER,"I'm sorry, Mr. Stane, I've tried. What you're asking for can't be done."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,Tony Stark was able to do it in a cave -- with a box of scraps.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,HEAD ENGINEER,"Well-- I'm not Tony Stark. HOLD ON - OBADIAH: his mind churning something. 134 INT. HALLWAY - STARK INDUSTRIES - NIGHT 134 After hours, few people around. Pepper hurries down the dimmed main hallway of Stark Industries. Casting nervous glances back behind her. 135 INT. TONY'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER - DAY 135 Pepper at Tony's computer. She plugs in the hacking device (the size of a jump-drive) Tony gave her. MONITOR: the screen as the device starts hacking through Obadiah's passwords, firewalls, security nets. She's in. She watches items scroll up from Obadiah's hard drive. MONITOR: Jericho Missile orders. Shipping manifests."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Make a copy of everything-- More. Schematics and blueprints. For sections of the Dynamo suit. For the pipe room under the Ark Reactor.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"What are you doing, Obadiah? She glances towards the door, thinking she heard something. Waits. Nothing. THE MONITOR: an icon now appears, with Arabic text underneath. An icon for a video clip. She double clicks, watches MONITOR a grainy video clip opens: Tony, half-dead, tied to a chair. Raza and his henchmen behind him. It's the 'decapitation tape' made in the cave months ago. She shakes her head, disbelieving."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Translate-- CLOSE ON - MONITOR: as the clip plays, the translated text appears like subtitles: ""Obadiah Stane, you have deceived us...the price to kill Tony Stark has just gone up..."" Pepper, shell-shocked, gapes at the monitor. PEPPER'S POV: she looks up from the monitor to see Stane standing there in the doorway. She nearly leaps out of her skin."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,What a nice surprise.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"I-- just wanted to get some of my personal stuff. (nods to the monitor) And my resume. In case. (grins) You know how I love job hunting. He circles around the desk and Pepper quickly changes screens, replacing the DOWNLOAD INDICATOR with GOOGLE."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,How's Tony?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Honestly-- I don't know. He's shut me out.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"You and everyone else. He circles her, picking up a photo on the desk of Tony. Pepper stiffens, flicks a glance at the hacking jump-drive protruding. The WHIRR and GRIND of the hard drive as it copies Stane's files."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"This-- thing between you, it's hurting him. You're the only real father Tony ever had. It would mean so much if you could just talk --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,(matter-of-fact) Tony's imploding -- it's unfortunate. (then) You should consider whether you want to take that ride with him.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"""Unfortunate?"""
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"You know I love Tony -- but this is business. We can't save him, but we can save his legacy. She flashes to the download screen, ""87%"" completed."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"It's tragic, but-- Tony never really came home, did he? He circles behind her again, looking closely at the screen again depicting Google ads."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"This company has a bright future, I'd like you to be a part of it. He smiles and touches her cheek. She shuts off the computer."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,Tony doesn't understand your value. He never did.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Are you-- offering me a job?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"Think about it. (then) Come on, I'll walk you out. He takes her box of personal effects, waits for her. As she passes the computer, she snatches the jump drive out, palming it. A tense moment: did he see her? 136 INT. LOBBY - STARK INDUSTRIES - DAY 136 Pepper descends the stairs as Obadiah hovers above on the balcony railing watching her. PEPPER'S POV: by the Security Desk, a savior: Agent Coulson gestures and argues with the Security Guard. Pepper rushes over, startles Coulson by linking arms with him and dragging him towards the door."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,COULSON,"Miss Potts, did you forget our appointment?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"No. Of course not. I've been very much looking forward to it. Let's-- (looks over her shoulder) why don't we do this somewhere else? They push outside. Obadiah still watches from above. 137 INT. TONY'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT 137 Noisy as Tony slaves away on the CNC machine. Behind him is-- A SCREEN: listing six messages, all the same: ""MISSED CALL - PEPPER."" Suddenly, the CNC machine powers down unexpectedly."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"What gives, Jarvis? JARVIS (O.S.) You have a visitor, Sir. Obadiah Stane is here. 138 INT. TONY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 138 Obadiah holds a pizza."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"It's UNOS. Four cheese. I just had it flown in from Chicago. Tony remains stoic. Obadiah puts the pizza down, crosses to Tony and hands him a letter."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"I'd like you to proofread something for me. JARVIS (O.S.) Would you like me to spell-check it, Sir?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,Can you turn him off? All the way?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"(as he scans the letter) Spin down Jarvis. Tony looks up from the letter, surprised."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Your resignation.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"You were right. It's not my company -- not my name on the building. We were a great team-- but I guess this is where our paths diverge. Tony hears a blip from the phone system. CLOSE ON - ANSWERING SYSTEM LCD ""INCOMING. PEPPER POTTS"" appears. Tony looks to Obadiah."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Pepper. I should take that.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"Tony. Please. I'll be out of here in a minute. Tony finally nods, pushes a button, sending the call to voicemail. Obadiah meets Tony's eyes, fatherly. Puts a hand on Tony's shoulder."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"We have too much history to part on bad terms. I'd like your blessing. Tony's eyes, suddenly registering a paralyzing pain. FLASH ON: Stane's ear, the blue electronic 'filter', like the ones he wore with Raza. Tony sinks back in his chair. Stane places the sonic taser down on the table."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"Easy, now. Try to breathe-- He kneels beside Tony. Unbuttons Tony's shirt."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"You can't mess with progress, Tony. It's an insult to the Gods. You created your greatest weapon ever but you think that means it belongs to you. It belongs to the world. CLOSE ON - TONY'S EYES: wide with pain, unable to move. All he can do is gasp and gurgle as Stane begins removing the chest-piece from its socket."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"Your ""heart"" will be the seed of the next generation of weapons. They'll help us steer the world back in the right direction -- put the balance of power back in our hands. The right hands. CLOSE ON - OBADIAH: he removes Tony's ""heart"", the RT glow reflecting on his face."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"By the time you die, my prototype will be operational. (smiles) It's not as conservative as yours. He wraps the heart in cloth. Then stands, clicking off the sonic taser and pocketing it. Tony rolls from the chair, onto his back, staring at the ceiling. Already slipping away. Then--"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,The sad thing is-- we're both the good guys. Obadiah kills the lights and leaves 139 INT. RHODEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 139 Rhodey is on the phone with Pepper.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"What do you mean, he paid to have Tony killed? Slow down. Why would Obadiah-- (listens) Where is Tony now? A140 INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT	A140 Pepper, Coulson and five dark-suited Agents walk with urgency towards two Crown Victorias. Pepper is on her cellphone, worried--"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"--I don't know, he's not answering his phone. Will you just go over there and check on him? Thanks Rhodey. She CLICKS off. The Agents pile into the Crown Vics, and Coulson holds a door open for her. Pepper instead beelines for her parked Audi."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"I know a shortcut. She hops in. Coulson looks at the Agent behind the wheel, then back at Pepper."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,COULSON,"I'll ride with her. Coulson hurries over, jumps in and the Audi races off. The Crown Vics try to keep up. 141 INT. TONY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 141 Tony, on fumes, pulls himself up a shelving system. It topples, spilling items, including the Lucite-encased heart Pepper gave him. He crawls to it, smashes it open. CLOSE ON - TONY'S HAND: lifting the glowing chest piece. 142 INT. SUB-BASEMENT PIPE ROOM - NIGHT 142 Obadiah inserts the glowing ""heart"" he stole from Tony's chest into the Dynamo's chest. We can only see slivers of the full suit on its scaffolding. The heart locks in place and we go -- CLOSE ON - DYNAMO'S EYES: coming alive. 143	143 Pepper and the Agents stand outside the locked door to the sub-basement pipe-room. An Agent finishes laying detonator cord around the door hinges."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,AGENT,Clear. They take cover and the Agent hits a clacker. The door is blown off its hinges. 144 INT. SUB-BASEMENT PIPE ROOM - NIGHT 144 Obadiah looks up at the SECURITY MONITORS: bad news. Pepper and the Agents infiltrating and moving towards the pipe room stairway. Obadiah's face sets. He begins climbing up the scaffolding to the Dynamo. B145 INT. TONY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT	B145 We HEAR A DOOR SPLINTERING. Rhodey rushes in and finds traces of blood on the floor. The collapsed shelving unit. Tony staggering to stay on his feet.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Where's Pepper?
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"Don't worry, she's with the Feds. They're on their way to Stark to arrest Obadiah."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"(grim--) They're going to need a lot more than a few Agents. Give me hand. 146 INT. TONY'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT 146 The door swings open and Tony and Rhodey enter. Rhodey stops shocked, his eyes playing over The Hall of Armor. The hanging Mark II suit. The weaponized battle-ready Mark III. Components, rows of helmets, boots, gauntlets and future design prototypes littered everywhere. 147 INT. SUB-BASEMENT PIPE ROOM - NIGHT 147 Pepper and the Agents drift through a metal jungle of vats, machines, armored limbs and guts hanging from tethers. Utility pipes run along the walls. They come upon the Mark I armor and stop, spooked. We notice: an empty scaffolding. Pepper advances, Coulson and his team fanning out. CLOSE ON - AN AGENT: looking off. Suddenly, he's yanked out of frame. 148 INT. TONY'S WORKSHOP - SAME TIME - NIGHT 148 Rhodey helps Tony rivet a last panel in place, then tosses him the Mark III helmet. Tony lowers the helmet. Blasts off through the hole in the ceiling, knocking it even wider. Rhodey stares after him, impressed as hell. Then he sees the Mark II, beelines for it. Considers, then shakes his head. He moves for Tony's car collection. Likes the R8. Hops in, fires her up and screeches after Tony. 149 INT. SUB-BASEMENT PIPE ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT 149 Wandering the fringes, Pepper tries to make a call on her cell. No signal. PEPPER'S POV: through the pipes and girders, she spots what may be a pair of glowing eyes. The WHIRR of hydraulics and GRINDING METAL wild gunfire suddenly breaks out. Bullets ricochet, hitting pipes, spewing steam and coolants. Pepper rushes away from the pandemonium. She whirls, squinting through the machine gears and steam, seeing flashes of agents running for cover, firing their guns at some giant flitting shadow. Another agent is yanked out of view and SCREAMS."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,ANGLE ON - PEPPER,"Panicked, trying to find a way out. A piece of metal zips at her head, cutting pipes before it embeds itself in the cement above her. And now an Agent staggers out of the murk with his radio."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,AGENT,"Agents down, agents down! (seeing Pepper)"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,GET OUT OF HERE --,"He throttles her towards the exit, then runs off, firing and Pepper, halfway up the stairs, turns hearing the three-ton THUMP of the Dynamo's legs charging out of the mist, but the armor is too big for the stairwell and crashes into it in a shower of debris. All we see is a brightly glowing chest-piece and arms, raking cement, grinding, trying to get up the stairs after Pepper, who fumbles her way up and out. 150 EXT. ARK REACTOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 150 Pepper slams the door behind her. Silence. She catches her breath, dials on her cell with shaky fingers --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Tony! Obadiah's got a whole assembly line under the Ark. He's inside one of them--! TONY (O.S.) Where are you--? Now she hears THUMP from below her. The asphalt cracks. Another THUMP and another and Pepper is knocked over as the asphalt bulges open to reveal the Dynamo's fist. Her cellphone skitters away. Like a hatching dinosaur, he peels away asphalt, pulling himself out of the ground, and finally Rises to his full height. He turns, face-to-face with Pepper, who's a gnat against this dull-grey leviathan."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"(backpedaling) Obadiah-- Dynamo keeps coming, not a single forgiving feature in the steel-face and dead eyes. Her foot hits her cellphone and she grabs it. And now she's almost backed up against the Plexiglas of the ARK Reactor when --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Tony-- TONY (O.S.) Pepper, I have one thing I need to say to you: DUCK! Pepper dives as-- The Dynamo stops, jerking his head up to see Iron Man, diving out of the sky at him, feet first. He lands on the Dynamo's shoulders, and the iron giants crash back into the hole Dynamo crawled from. 151 INT. SUB-BASEMENT PIPE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 151 The warriors fall and hit a grating. Dynamo breaks through, plunging through pipes and into the water below, while -- Iron Man tumbles along the unbroken part of the grating and falls out of sight. 152 EXT. ARK REACTOR - SAME TIME - NIGHT 152 The atrium glass ruptures outward from the underground impact. Pepper dives to shield herself. She sees the reactor-housing has been cracked. KLAXONS BLARE. Warning lights flash as the damaged reactor begins to 'melt down'. 153 INT. SUB-BASEMENT PIPE ROOM - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT 153 DYNAMO'S POV: We emerge out of the water, searching for Iron Man. 154 INT. TONY'S SUIT - SAME TIME - NIGHT 154 POV - MOVING: sweeping around the steel-maze with his INFRARED, but perforated steam pipes cast red plumes and confusing shadows everywhere. OBADIAH (O.S.) It's miraculous, Tony, it's your Ninth Symphony. Trying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"This wasn't meant for the world. Still moving, still swiveling through the murk -- OBADIAH (O.S.) How can you be so selfish? Do you understand what you've created? This will put the balance of power back in our hands for decades. Your country needs this."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"What kind of world will it be when everybody's got one? OBADIAH (O.S.) Your father helped give us the bomb. What kind of world would it be if he'd failed us? 155 INT. DYNAMO SUIT - SAME TIME 155 STANE'S POV: waiting, as Iron Man emerges from behind machinery and girders. He doesn't see Dynamo, who charges -- CUT TO: 156 INT. PIPE ROOM - SAME TIME 156 Iron Man realizes too late that Dynamo is coming at him like a bullet-train. He's hit, driven backwards in Dynamo's vice- grip, and they smash into the cement wall and punch clean through it onto -- 157 EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 157 They crash into a truck trailer, passing through it and onto the highway, tossing vehicles aside. More cars screech, collide. A HYDROGEN-POWERED bus jack- knives, narrowly averting disaster. People flee vehicles. In Tony's H.U.D., ""INCOMING CALL"" flashes-- PEPPER (O.S.) TONY -- ARE YOU THERE?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"A little busy, Pepper-- PEPPER (O.S.) The reactor's been it--"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Get to the control room. Shut it down-- PEPPER (O.S.) How the hell do I shut it down?? Dynamo rises first, grabs a Volvo station-wagon with a stunned mother and kids inside. Iron Man rises as the Dynamo lifts the car over his head."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Don't. This is our fight.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"People are always going to die, Tony -- part of the chess game. 158 INT. VOLVO - SAME TIME - NIGHT 158 The world skewed fifteen feet below them. The mother white- knuckles the steering wheel in terror. The kids scream. CUT TO: Tony, trying his palm RTs. Nothing. TONY (O.S.) Emergency power! JARVIS (O.S.) Sir, you'll drain the -- TONY (O.S.) NOW! Dynamo winds up to throw the car when Iron Man nails him with a huge Repulsor blast from his chest. Dynamo is knocked back, throwing the car at Iron Man, who catches it. But the weight is too much for his armor to handle and he buckles, saving the car from impact, but gets trapped underneath it. CUT TO: Tony's HEADS-UP DISPLAY: ""POWER CRITICAL: RECHARGING."" CUT TO: Inside the Volvo, it takes everyone a moment to realize they're okay. Then, as Dynamo clumps towards them-- KID IN THE BACKSEAT GO, MOM! GO -- She stamps the gas. CUT TO: Iron Man, dragged as the Volvo speeds forward. A shower of sparks fly from his suit. A wild weaving ride. Dynamo follows, using cars as stepping stones.

Tail lights flash past like tracers as he slaloms through tight traffic. CUT TO: Iron Man finally manages to push the car off him. It speeds away, three gaping Kids staring out the back. Tony staggers up, trying to regain his footing as Dynamo pulls up. They clash in a CACOPHONY of steel and GRINDING HYDRAULICS. Stane knocks Tony into a mini-van and pounds him mercilessly.

Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,You know what happens when that reactor blows. A lot of people are going to die.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"It didn't have to end like this, Tony. You were down -- you should've stayed down. And they're about to collide again when a Shit Kicking Biker on a Harley weaves from around a truck. He realizes his mistake and jams the throttle, but Dynamo grabs the front wheel of the motorbike, (sending the Biker flying), and in one swoop belts Iron Man with it. Tony tumbles away and struggles to get up. Falls, tries again, but Dynamo is all over him, smacking him with the bike. 162 INT. TONY'S AUDI R8 - DRIVING - SAME TIME - NIGHT 162 Rhodey, in the breakdown lane, weaving around waves of fleeing people, toppled cars and debris till he sees -- Dynamo standing over Tony, about to deliver his death-blow. He red lines the engine and pops the clutch. CUT TO: 163 EXT. HIGHWAY - SAME TIME - NIGHT 163 The R8 rockets forward. Zero to sixty in under three seconds. The Dynamo raises the Harley over his head, ready to smash Tony's already broken helmet. He looks up a second too late the car hits Dynamo's leg and crumples, tumbling away like a toy, and now the Dynamo, un-weighted, reels around to catch his balance, but pitches head-first into the hydrogen bus perforating it. CLOSE ON - DYNAMO: struggling to free himself. His groping fingers set off a spark and HELLFIRE ERUPTS blanking the Dynamo and everything around it. Flames roll over Tony. Over the crushed sports car, igniting its leaking tanks. Tony removes his broken helmet and staggers to the car, tearing it open like a can."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"You had to take my car. He pulls out Rhodey, dazed and bloody."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,Saving your ass is getting to be a full-time job. They regard the burning bus. Nothing moves. Just a heap of red-hot steel.

Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,Thanks for checking in Tony. Delta's at 2300. It's not going down. TONY (O.S.) It's too late.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Too late? What's going to happen? TONY (O.S.) It's going to blow a crater a mile wide. I'm coming to get you. She backs away from the monitors, disbelieving. 165 INT. TONY'S SUIT - FLYING - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT 165 He heads towards the reactor, now a shimmering mass of energy. A row of SATELLITE DISHES on the roof of the reactor. It sparks an idea."

Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"No, it's compressing energy. We're going to convert the plasma core to electricity and channel it up through the roof. Like a Tesla coil. 167 INT. ARK REACTOR CONTROL ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT 167 Pepper watches the core bulge."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"I don't need a science lesson, just tell me what button to push -- TONY (O.S.) See a red submarine hatch? A wheel -- a red wheel."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"--no. YES -- She runs to it. 168 EXT. ARK REACTOR ROOF - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT 168 Tony re-arranges satellite dishes, pulling wires creating a makeshift Tesla coil."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Open it all the way, then standby to hit the master. We've only got one shot at this. He's connecting a wire when the satellite dish beside him reflects an eerie yellow flicker. He turns, stunned as -- THE DYNAMO LANDS on the roof. Flames still licking off his blackened suit. Obadiah moves closer to Tony --"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Pepper, hit the switch. PEPPER -- 169 INT. ARK REACTOR CONTROL ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT 169 Electromagnetic tentacles arc from the reactor to the control room around Pepper."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"TONY? Which Master Switch -- She eyes her phone. It's dead. And in front of her -- A row of ""MASTER"" switches blink--"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"I am so looking for another job. 170 EXT. ARK REACTOR ROOF - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT 170 The Dynamo, smoking like an oil fire, about to reach Tony. 171 INT. ARK REACTOR CONTROL ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT 171 Pepper hits all the switches, then diving under the consoles for cover as the world goes steel-blue. An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) flashes upwards along the reactor. 172 EXT. ARK REACTOR ROOF - A SECOND LATER - NIGHT 172 As the searing flash of the EMP is momentarily 'halted' between the satellite dishes, vaporizing the roof in between. Then -- The EMP surges outwards, turning Dynamo and Iron Man into statues as the pulse knocks out his power and electronics. FROM UP HIGH: the EMP blast travels concentrically outwards, rendering everything dark in its wake. BACK TO: The roof, as it sags down in the center. Tony, dazed, looks at his heart-device. It's dead too. The Dynamo, closest to the collapsed section of the roof, topples over. Its dead fingers catch on a seam and it lies precariously on the edge of the 'slope'. The Dynamo hatch opens, revealing Obadiah. OBADIAH'S POV: through the hole in the roof, the seething plasma bubbling below. Tony, using his own waning strength, tries to extend a dead Iron Man hand to Obadiah."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,Take my hand--
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"So this is the answer, Tony? This is how you're going to save the world? It's not in you. Your father told me before he died, my boy doesn't have a warrior's heart. I should have listened."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,My father never knew me.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,But I do. Now we see what Stane is attempting: to manually winch his forearm rocket bay open so he can blast Tony. But his movements unsettle the Dynamo suit and suddenly he begins to slide.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,OBADIAH,"Goodbye, my boy--"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"This is just the beginning. And now Obadiah shuts the hatch and tumbles away. He plunges down through the ARK's silo, splashes into the plasma which HISSES and swallows him up. Tony remains, shutting his eyes. 173 INT. ARK REACTOR - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT 173 Pepper rises, staring at the bubbling plasma. Not sure who fell in there. She runs out. 174 EXT. ARK REACTOR ROOF - TEN MINUTES LATER - NIGHT 174 Tony frozen in his dead suit. He's not moving. Two flashlights cut the darkness and Tony bats his eyes to see Rhodey and Pepper picking their way towards him. DISSOLVE TO: 175 INT. STARK INDUSTRIES - HALLWAY - MOVING - DAY 175 Tony and Pepper walk along the hallway. Pepper shoves a written statement into his hands."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Here, your alibi. You were on your yacht. I've got port papers that put you in Avalon all night, and sworn statements from fifty of your guests."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"Maybe it was just the two of us. On the yacht, I mean."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Focus, please. Tony grabs an L.A. Times from the pile of papers in her arms, glances at the headline: ""WHO IS THE IRON MAN?"" A grainy newspaper photo of the iron battle at Stark Industries."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"""Iron Man"". Not technically accurate, since it's mostly carbon- fiber and ceramic. But I like the ring of it. ""Iron Man"". They turn a corner. Tony suddenly stops. Meets her eyes."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"You know-- that night at the concert hall. Do you ever think about it? For a moment there is nothing else in the world but the two of them. Then, with a tinge of sadness--"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"I don't know what you're talking about, Mr. Stark. She brings her hands up and fixes his unruly tie knot. All business."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,PEPPER,"Will that be all, Mr. Stark?"
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,"That will be all Miss Potts. 176 INT. STARK INDUSTRIES LOBBY - MINUTES LATER 176 Rhodey is in mid-speech, in front of assembled reporters."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,RHODEY,"--I can confirm that a series of military test-prototypes were involved in the incident at Stark Industries last night. I can also confirm that there was, for a brief time, the danger of an Ark Reactor ""incident"", which was rectified without injury to the public -- and all power outages have been restored. Here now, to answer a few brief questions, is Tony Stark. Tony walks out. Takes the podium. Puts a hand up to silence the bubbling questions."
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,I've seen the papers. I've heard the reports. That's why I want to put an end to all this wild speculation. The truth is-- He looks to Rhodey. To Pepper. To the crowd.
Iron_Man_Full_Script,,TONY,I am Iron Man. The Reporters erupt in a CACOPHONY-- We end on Tony's face.
